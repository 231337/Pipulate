Greetings Diehards,

Now you have a machine gun ho ho ho. If you know that quote and are in this
biz, then hello old-timer. If not, then welcome millennial newb! I promise you
boring coding industry buzzword jockeying for an awesome future-talk which if
you survive the boredom, just may be synaptically rewiring. I'm the
silver-tongue snake-oil salesmen (I ***wish*** I could cite that quote) who
made the still-going-strong HitTail SEO tool in 2006, and SEO Notebook is my
latest stay-relevant-ware that I'm peddling for some audience and Github street
cred.  As this README.md probably already indicates, this is something a little
bit different. So if you're into learning Python and/or a burgeoning nextgen
SEO community, then forge on! Even if you're only interested in Python, SEO
Notebook may be of interest as a sample project designed to generically
interact with the Web and whatever random APIs you please.

It's 10 years after HitTail, and I've done a number of interesting things
working the biz, here in New York -- even though I jumped from in-house (where
all the interesting work is) to agency-side (where all the PowerPoints are). I
was the SEO for Apple, Kraft, JCPenney, and was even at the top of the Empire
State Building as the SEO for SAP for awhile, tackling some of the industry's
biggest challenges. My SEO Kung Fu was good, but this was (and is always) an
industry in flux. Assume nothing. Be proactive. Nobody should be waiting for
RankBrain to gradually get smarter and stop rewarding our sites by 100 1%
increments. We should be getting out ahead of Google, and change the
cat-and-mouse game into a human domesticating the cat game. Us nextgen SEOs are
raising Google like a child and need to start thinking about it that way.

As a father of a 5 year-old, I am beginning to recognize the process of
watching an thing gradually develop, and in-turn become something that itself
can begin to recognize a process. This is what's happening with Google, and
I'll be carrying out my own Machine Learning education here, starting with this
Github repo. Machine Learning techniques will get blended in with SEO Notebook
if even just for familiarity's sake, because Google sure is. There very culture
is gradually being re-written around ML. And as they do, their own secret
weapons improve -- eventually, exponentially.  Now, Google has machine learning
machine guns like TensorFlow ho ho ho. This is not yet-another-skynet-warning
(YASW?) but rather, stating the obvious.

Proof? Just watch your customized Google Auto-Suggest (the part that fills in
under your dropdown menu while you type) get smarter and smarter, combining
recently used terms with new terms, simply because the data is there to support
that it may be a good idea! Auto Suggest is going to be a clear stage on which
you can watch Google's IQ grow. This is all obviously human-aided, but Google's
learning and we should all be preparing for a world where, rather than hunting
you down, certain classes of robots should instead should instead be thought of
as something you can't trick... not very well, and not for long.

I feel that Google is on the verge of growing smarter from a RankBrain
perspective at a much faster rate than a human being grows smarter growing up.
We're all just given 100 years on this planet, and such. Google's part of the
first generation of Machine Learning super-systems that's going to be given
much, much longer than that, so long as it remains successful as a public
company. We in the field don't have to really concern ourselves with THAT
long-term (though, I certainly am as a father), but we should understand the
compelling reason behind these steps along the way, as things like the Panda
algorithm tweaks that we all fell in love with as the new Google Dance went
away, to replace by "Phantom". Well, there are no phantoms. It's just better
systems.

Google's AI stuff may never evolve into SkyNet, but it will pass the Turning
Test sometime soon; you can be assured of that. Batteries and miniaturization
to make it something we all can have in our houses serving us like Ex Machina
housekepers is a much larger challenge. Though, we should kinda sorta be
preparing for that too, with our Raspberry Pi's and autolocomitive telepresence
projects (my own version coming soon). Baby-steps! Lucrative. Relevant. Fun.
These are the attributes of my projects and my approach.

Our projects should really be just that interesting, and coming to us naturally
as we think, and implemented naturally as we can express ourselves in our
historically spoken and written languages that we learn for communicating to
other human beings. Human-to-machine languages should be no less interesting or
expressive than English, and should be no less pleasurable and beautiful than
finely crafted poetry, and should be no more limiting than then best that
today's state of technology and recorded history has ever made possible. We are
in a new FOSS society (free and open source software) where the best ideas
eventually and ultimately rise to the top (once they penetrate a layer of ego
and generational curmudgeondgy). So, it's time to get coding and speaking to
machines as naturally as I'm speaking to you in English.

Python is that language. The Anaconda install is your starting point. I'll make
a case briefly. Many of you Macolites are going to think Ruby, because it's
what Rails is on, and ROR has enjoyed a certain degree of cool-kids notoriety
due to Ruby being shipped with Macs, and Rails being the first joyful framework
to catch the fancy of the hordes of ASP and PHP refuges in the early zero's.
Others will figure JavaScript is the one language to rule them all, thanks to a
loosely-typed event-driven concurrent design that runs quite nicely on the
server as well, thanks to node.js. You would be the "full web stack" crowd -- a
euphemism for "I also dabble in node". All legit. All valid. All inferior to
learning Python through Jupyter Notebook. This is because... FOSS and science.
Because Fernando Perez make a MatLab Notebook killer on Python first, and
everyone's been jumping on that bandwagon ever since. Access to 2-billion users
because JavaScript is the default language of browsers isn't enough to elevate
JavaScript over something that already exists as a better native spoken machine
language and is already in the position to put up a good fight. I wouldn't bet
against JavaScript, but I'm ALSO betting on Python.

But Python needs that boost in the arm. Done! You can take the IPython out of
IPython Notebook, but we all know what the Pi in Raspberry Pi stands for. No
amount of revisionism can erase Python -- and I smile at the thought of all
that Ruby railing and JavaScript prototype object rattling that such fightin
words probably invokes. But Ruby has Rails and JavaScript has the browser. What
does poor ol' Python have, except the fact that the entire Google empire was
built on it's shoulders?

No, Python's game changer is not Django or even yet another framework. It's
because it's Jupyter Notebook in its ability to let you fully learn and see and
appreciate Python itself as the framework it is.  Python is precisely the level
of abstraction you should be dealing at in order to make coding feel like what
coding should feel like -- basically what you're doing when you're talking or
writing English (or whatever is your native spoken language), for that is
coding too. You are ***ENCODING*** your thoughts and ideas into... language!
Surprise, you're already a coder! That's your reward for getting this far, in
this long rant of a README. Surprise! You've begun reading my "interactively,
learn Python" book, in which I teach you to be an SEO.

And now to tick off the Java compsci one-right-way because I read the design
patterns book in school crowd. Many of today's Java folks are this generation
of <a href="http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/EWD/transcriptions/EWD04xx/EWD498.html">BASIC</a>ally
myopic static-typed ludites that will never open your mind to a language that
discourages getters and setters.  Their way is right, and theirs is the direct
word of the very fine Design Patterns book, which itself is correct from its
point of view, but is not the be-all/end-all of how people should express
themselves through code on this planet.

Pythonic code can be brief and beautiful, and fully legitimate from a
java==compsci standpoint, because of use-case appropriateness. We do not need
to use the define-everything-compulsively mentality required for something that
you know will grow to become millions of lines of code interacted with by
hundreds of developers, such as sees to be the assumption of a language that
makes you public static void the most basic hello world's. Just use Python.
It's a language by a very smart individual trying to make solving impressively
complex tasks easy for YOU -- the newb learner. Python is anti-elitist in
nature. And wouldn't you Java folks like to leave behind the curly brackets and
overhead overkill dot-dot-dot-everything while still having static typed
variables? Try Python 3.x and MyPy. You might be pleasantly surprised how nice
codebases become on large projects with the best of both worlds.

And maybe most recently significant is that the Scientists are now onboard with
this Python thing -- no... they were already onboard long ago with a rich 25
year history. What's different is that now they're just opening the door and
saying "Hey, the water's nice and comfortable over here... hop on by!" with
such innovative solutions to sharing code-execution-environments as Anaconda by
Continuum.io, which I at first dismissed as just a bunch of pre-installs that
non-Linux users had to suffer (you could always run a VM on your Mac/Windows,
which I did). And then I realized how nice it was when your encapsulation layer
was a web-based IDE (and NOT a whole Linux machine VM) that unlocked all the
power of your local machine. Wow! Throw in Github-friendliness and the ability
to stream output to the user through the duration of sometimes long-running
jobs... and dead-simple multiple Python VM kernel maintenance? Wow, out goes my
Pipulate UI work, and in comes Jupyter Notebook... uh... SEO Notebook... and
probably, SEO Lab, that that's a story for another time.

So, this project exists basically to sharpen my SEO-blade again, as I switch to
a new master, yet again. I am much more effective in Samurai mode, because
while I COULD go off to work for myself, the only real difference between
drawing a paycheck and working for myself is the amount of hustle and amount of
paper-work you need to do -- principally, both go WAY UP! I'm a draw-a-paycheck
sort of guy, but I'm not satisfied with static situations. Things must be
dynamic! I must be able to express myself creatively, and to great effect. I
feel the need to move mountains, and be recognized for carrying out monumental
and communally useful tasks.

Those are the accolades normally going to folks like Linus and Guido. More
recently, I've been coming to appreciate those to whom you must connect a last
name to be recognized by those outside some very geeky circles, and those folks
would be the likes of Raymond Hettinger and Kenneth Reitz. And this? This
humble little project is just the latest incarnation of my "system", which I
always have under development and in active use in some form or another.
HitTail was just one small extraction from one such system -- an Ajaxy,
server-push, real-time analytics approach to it all before any of that was even
a wistful gleam in the eye of today's JavaScript-this-that-and-the-other-thing
library authors. I always see the big next thing, even if I never am the one
rewarded for it.

Today's big-next-thing is the sort of portability of easily-studied
ready-to-run programming code that comes equipped with its own execution
environment and dependency-satisfier built-in. It should be an environment that
can actually SERVE AS the input/output widgets in a pinch, so you can fully
develop something that could become much more run-on-a-server-like apps in the
future. But contrary-wise, they need not HAVE TO to still be useful on a
day-in/day-out basis to those who use such tools in more of a hands-on
power-tool sort of way (instead of scheduled, batched, and invisibly run off in
the distance somewhere). Jupyter Notebook is the ideal environment for SEO
Swiss Army Knife-like utilities.

Today, I live strongly centered in Linux, Python, vim and git. This is that one
driving project that I'm constantly using professionally, every day as my
secret weapon, molding it this way and that to suit every purpose and every
little custom one-off project, and eventually scalable and productize-able
extractions of every sort. The project has just been rebooted from one of my
other projects, named Pipulate, which I will constantly be raiding, while I
bring the best of that already-amazing project over to here, where followers
WON'T have to set up servers or try to match my mad vim skills just to get
working. Instead, I'll be adjusting my YouTube video series so that ANY video
in the series is a strong jumping-on point for this particular bandwagon.

Apologies for those who would prefer a README to be of a more concrete how-to
nature. That, like so many things in this project, is coming soon.

Things to do here:

- Add all my links to follow this project's development on YouTube and such
- Actually use this system to do various clever things - show use-cases
- "Can" the using of this system, probably an examples sub-folder
