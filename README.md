Greetings Diehards,

Now you have a machine gun ho ho ho. If you know that quote and are in this
biz, then hello old-timer. If not, then welcome millennial newb! I promise you
boring coding industry buzzword jockeying for an awesome future-talk which if
you survive the boredom, just may be synaptically rewiring. I'm the
silver-tongue snake-oil salesmen (I **wish** I could cite that quote) who made
the still-going-strong HitTail SEO tool in 2006, and SEO Notebook is my latest
stay-relevant-ware that I'm peddling for some audience and Github street cred.

It's 10 years later, and I've done a number of interesting things working the
biz, here in New York. I was even at the top of the Empire State Building as
the primary SEO for SAP there for a few months. My SEO Kung Fu was good, but
this was an industry in flux. Nobody should be waiting for RankBrain to
gradually get smarter and stop rewarding our sites by 100 1% increments. We
should be getting out ahead of Google, and change the cat-and-mouse game into a
human domesticating the cat game. Us nextgen SEOs are raising Google like a
child. So, let's get programming!

But where to start? Many of you Macolites are going to think Ruby, because it's
what Rails is on, and ROR has enjoyed a certain degree of cool-kids notoriety
due to Ruby being shipped with Macs, and Rails being the first joyful framework
to catch the fancy of the hordes of ASP and PHP refuges in the early zero's.
Others will figure JavaScript is the one language to rule them all, thanks to
a loosely-typed even-driven concurrent design that runs quite nicely on the
server as well, thanks to node.js. You would be the "full web stack" crowd -- a
euphemism for "I also dabble in node". All legit. All valid. All inferior to
learning Python through Jupyter Notebook.

You Java-folks, there's nothing I can do for you. You are today's generation of
BASIC'ally myopic static-typed ludites that will never open your mind to a
language that discourages getters and setters. Pythonic code can be brief and
beautiful, and fully legitimate from a compsci standpoint, because of use-case
appropriateness. We do not need to use the define-everything-compulsively
mentality required for something that you know will grow to become millions of
lines of code interacted with by hundreds of developers, such as sees to be the
assumption of a language that makes you public static void the most basic hello
world's. Just use Python. It's a language by a very smart individual trying to
make solving impressively complex tasks easy for YOU -- the newb learner.
Python is anti-elitist in nature.

So why not kick off a Github repo with dem's fightin' words? Sure, it's
troll-bait and flame tinder. But this is Jupyter Notebook, damn it! The
Scientists are now onboard with this Python thing -- no... they were already
onboard. Now, they're just opening the door and saying "Hey, the water's nice
and comfortable over here... hop on by!" with such innovative solutions to
sharing code-execution-environments as Anaconda by Continuum.io, which I at
first dismissed as just a bunch of pre-installs that non-Linux users had to
suffer (you could always run a VM on your Mac/Windows, which I did). And then I
realized how nice it was when your encapsulation layer was a web-based IDE.
Wow! Throw in Github-friendliness and the ability to stream output to the user
through the duration of sometimes long-running jobs... and dead-simple multiple
Python VM kernel maintenance? Wow, out goes my Pipulate UI work, and in comes
Jupyter Notebook... uh... SEO Notebook... and probably, SEO Lab, that that's a
story for another time.

So, this project exists basically to sharpen my SEO-blade again, as I switch to
a new master, yet again. I am much more effective in Samurai mode, because
while I COULD go off to work for myself, the only real difference between
drawing a paycheck and working for myself is the amount of hustle and amount of
paper-work you need to do -- principally, both go WAY UP! I'm a draw-a-paycheck
sort of guy, but I'm not satisfied with static situations. Things must be
dynamic! I must be able to express myself creatively, and to great effect. I
feel the need to move mountains, and be recognized for carrying out monumental
and communally useful tasks. 

Those are the accolades normally going to folks like Linus and Guido. More
recently, I've been coming to appreciate those to whom you must connect a last
name to be recognized by those outside some very geeky circles, and those folks
would be the likes of Raymond Hettinger and Kenneth Reitz. And this? This
humble little project is just the latest incarnation of my "system", which I
always have under development and in active use in some form or another.
HitTail was just one small extraction from one such system -- an Ajaxy,
server-push, real-time analytics approach to it all before any of that was even
a wistful gleam in the eye of today's JavaScript-this-that-and-the-other-thing
library authors. I always see the big next thing, even if I never am the one
rewarded for it.

Today's big-next-thing is the sort of portability of easily-studied
ready-to-run programming code that comes equipped with its own execution
environment and dependency-satisfier built-in. It should be an environment that
can actually SERVE AS the input/output widgets in a pinch, so you can fully
develop something that could become much more run-on-a-server-like apps in the
future. But contrary-wise, they need not HAVE TO to still be useful on a
day-in/day-out basis to those who use such tools in more of a hands-on
power-tool sort of way (instead of scheduled, batched, and invisibly run off in
the distance somewhere). Jupyter Notebook is the ideal environment for SEO
Swiss Army Knife-like utilities.

Today, I live strongly centered in Linux, Python, vim and git. This is that one
driving project that I'm constantly using professionally, every day as my
secret weapon, molding it this way and that to suit every purpose and every
little custom one-off project, and eventually scalable and productize-able
extractions of every sort. The project has just been rebooted from one of my
other projects, named Pipulate, which I will constantly be raiding, while I
bring the best of that already-amazing project over to here, where followers
WON'T have to set up servers or try to match my mad vim skills just to get
working. Instead, I'll be adjusting my YouTube video series so that ANY video
in the series is a strong jumping-on point for this particular bandwagon.

Apologies for those who would prefer a README to be of a more concrete how-to
nature. That, like so many things in this project, is coming soon.
