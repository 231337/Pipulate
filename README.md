# Free &amp; Open Source SEO Software That Teaches You Python Hello World! I'm
Mike Levin, an SEO in New York City. That is, I help people connect their
website content with their intended audience, and I'm here to teach you how to
do the same, perchance to learn a little Python 3.5 programming as you go.

This latest rendition of Pipulate runs from within an amazing programming
environment called Jupyter Notebook, which replaces the prior version (still in
this repo's history) that ran on Python 2.7 on a webserver. The old webserver
approach made Pipulate a bit hard to set up and customize, but the new version
takes advantage of the game-changing tool in data science being taken up by
scientists all over the world to make their research more shareable.

The moment I truly groked what Jupyter Notebook was, I re-wrote Pipulate from
scratch, targeting it and Python 3.5, making the code one-tenth of its original
size, making it easier to run, and much more enticing to get you to go in and
customize it to your own purposes -- whether you're already a Python programmer
or not. 

I encourage you to take a look at the new code, and I'll start posting
links to the YouTube videos here that will introduce you to the new system and
help get you up and running. Until those videos appear, simply go to the
continuum.io website, and download Anaconda for your host operating system:

I'm working on the instructions, so check back soon. And just to show you how
important Jupyter Notebook already is, Github already renders them correctly:
