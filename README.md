# Free &amp; Open Source SEO Software That Teaches You Python

## Who Am I?

Hello World! I'm Mike Levin, an SEO in New York City. That is, I help people
like you connect website content with ***your*** intended audience, and I'm
here to teach you how to do the same, perchance to learn a little Python 3.5
programming as you go. 

***My*** intended audience for this project is SEO specialists looking for
beter, more long-term tools that they can customize themselves -- or just
people looking for a good project to get started with learning Python, SEO, and
very soon, machine learning and data science.

## What Is This?  

This latest rendition of Pipulate runs from within an amazing programming
environment called Jupyter Notebook, which replaces the prior version of
Pipulate (still in this repo's history) that ran on Python 2.7 on a webserver.
The old webserver approach made this tool a bit hard to set up, and didn't
exactly encourage you to go in and start customizing the Python code. But this
version takes advantage of the game-changing tool in data science being taken
up by scientists all over the world to make their research more shareable.

## Jupyter Notebook

The moment I truly groked what Jupyter Notebook was, I re-wrote Pipulate from
scratch, targeting it and Python 3.5, making the code one-tenth of its original
size, making it easier to run, and much more enticing to get you to go in and
customize it to your own purposes -- whether you're already a Python programmer
or not. The funny thing here is that now that Jupyter Notebook exists, Python,
and the whole coding thing is lots more accessible to non-technical folks who
need these sort of data manipulation abilities the most... scientists! It's a
bandwagon that marketers would do well for themselves to jump onto.

## Next Steps

I encourage you to take a look at the new code, and I'll start posting
links to the YouTube videos here that will introduce you to the new system and
help get you up and running. Until those videos appear, simply go to the
continuum.io website, and download Anaconda for your host operating system:

I'm working on the instructions, so check back soon. And just to show you how
important Jupyter Notebook already is, Github already renders them correctly:
