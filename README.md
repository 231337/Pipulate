Welcome back my friends to the code that never ends. I'm so glad you can
attend. Come inside, come inside! ... And by that, I mean watch [this 
YouTube playlist:](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SdzDaohx-GA&list=PLy-AlqZFg6G8tBTB6FFN68mryG4JlCaf-)

I propose to make you more technical in a way much more meaningful in your life
(and your children's?) than merely becoming another fad-chasing cloud
programmer. Although I'm confident that this particular github project, GroPeY,
is a killer app in my fields of SEO and Social Media, it also serves as a great
example of the type of education I plan on offering the world when I can spend
more time on it. I'm going off to kickstart it right now today, and I will come
back and provide the link here.

Meanwhile, feel free to use this project as a way to learn Python from scratch
(more or less). I have earlier YouTube playlists
[here if you don't have a Raspberry Pi](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zeBJE1r0VI&list=PLy-AlqZFg6G9pDJR3ZWuOfUCC4sMJu4uD) 
and
[here if you do](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4c--k_dvjs&list=PLy-AlqZFg6G-TMinlBfMpGwEQGcrb1LGS) 
that might also help.
