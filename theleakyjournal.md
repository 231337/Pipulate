### @11 w/ Michael Levin at 11:00

Okay, it's coming up on 8:00 AM, and I'm going to baby-sit the running of the
scripts from home, and maybe get into the office even a little bit later than
usual. I'll be in to meet Co-worker, but I'm not going to be in a rush to waste
my best creative morning energy fighting Staten Islanders in the friggin cattle
shoot. For the first time since the Check Cashing store I had to take over
right when I turned 21 and graduated college when my dad died is there another
thing in my life that earned "friggin" as part of its label.

Sheesh! Talk about outliers and bad timing. Had I received that extra boost
like I'm giving Adi... well, let's just say I'm glad I read Malcolm Gladwell
early enough that I took it also as a sort of parenting guide. Adi's turning 8
soon, and that's plenty of time to start zeroing in on her passions and
interests that'll take the 10,000 hours. Let's start with letting her explore
ages 7 through 10. At 10 or 11 encourage her to "go for it" whatever it is, and
be completely supportive financially, emotionally and logistically. I should
probably leave strategy to her... though I may chime in a suggestion here or
there. Make the idea hers initially if at all possible. Not too Machiavellian.
It's all for the greater good @11!

And so it's like with the Tardigrade Circus. It's not that I don't have the
capability or interest or raw material. It's that a preponderance of things in
my life has to be conducive to that sort of thing happening. So you have to
layer it up. Have consistency. Commit to a path. Maintain state with your
on-the-fly invented systems-- the principle one of which is developing that
"internal voice" of yours, which is what these @11 things I believe are going
to be about.

### Focus on Mastering the USE of the Tool (not on inventing yet another tool)

The rest of today is going to be about automating a join of some new data into
the main sheet. All the thought-work I put into how to manage this stuff
without "a system" beyond what standard Linux/Python provides is going to
pay-off big-time (I think). I'm on the verge of it, opening the dike... The
Netherlands being below sea level and the little Dutch boy has LOTS of metaphor
application, of which I'm going to steer clear of every one, so I can get on
with the business of final automation... after a short break.

Took my break and had a great chat with Boss about the coming changes. The rest
of the day is going to be about getting home to wrap up the automation work
from home tonight. It makes no difference where you work now, and you're going
to want to be in the office tomorrow to meet Matt O. He's taking the time to
commute here, which is NOT easy for him, and one of the big points is for him
to start showing me the mock-ups for the dashboards. Boss making him be very
explicit. I need do start reading about that API.

Try to do as much of it as you can before you leave. When you get home, let it
be you-time. Get through it, 1, 2, 3... 1? Okay, pretty much everything is done
now except for the datestamps and the secondary sheet. First tackle the
datestamps. That will look MOST wrong. I can always maybe disable the secondary
sheet and say the issues there were a little more difficult than I thought
(which they are). But the datestamps I keep getting wrong, so nail it...
fundamentally. Put something in Pipulate for it.

Hmmm. Put the dateranges themselves right in pipulate. That's pretty bold. That
certainly justifies staying late tonight. Adi will be calling soon. Make
whatever you do tonight TOTALLY COMPATIBLE with talking with her. She takes
priority!

Stayed at the office to talk with Adi tonight, and then even did a little
daterange work after that. I didn't finish the automation, but this'll be one
of those nights/mornings/experiences. I don't need to knock myself out. I just
need to knock it out of the ballpark. Things are coming together. I'm a little
bit sorry I had to come up with a system to patch old reports rather than just
move to the new field-mapped reserved row-1 approach (can't wait!), but the
whole Live Reports ARE Templates, placeholder-columns, shadow copies mental
framework HAD to be constructed. There's always going to be shitty old reports
that we need to phase out... well, in phases. Patch now. Polish later.

Laptops are for laps again! I'm sitting here at the Staten Island Ferry
Terminal Manhattan-side waiting for the 11:00 PM ferry because the 10:30 one
was cancelled due to a medical emergency. As with so many things in life, my
timing could hardly be any worse. But hey, that's what makes my journey my
journey. Minimize regrets. Work in multiple passes. Don't let the crazy nervous
energies consume you, and definitely help Adi work through them. She will be
well served learning to navigate with a calm, quiet and competent inner voice
at a much earlier age than I did.

So, what's the topic of this post? I think it's publishable. I'm in the
noosphere for sure. I think I'm forging some new territory, and it's time to
bear down on it and keep doing more and more of it rather than is your old
habit of backing off and self-sabotaging-- because the time isn't right, or I'm
scared or whatever. I can make it happen for myself whenever I like, and I like
to keep telling myself that. It's time to start really... what's my metaphor?
Heating the iron and striking it while it's hot. And fold it and make the right
alloy and learn to use what I've built like a master... oh wait! I don't have
to hammer metal. Guido van Rossum already did that. Focus on mastering use of
the tool.

### Concerning Mastering Tools With Muscle Memory in Field of Tech

Okay, this will be the last morning manually updating the revenue stuff. The
automation is ready to go, and I just need to do some copy/pasting. Special
emphasis on building date-range timestamps into the overall system.

There's a lot of overall system stuff-- the house of brick stuff that I need to
pivot to immediately after this patch-project. Today is about all the tiny
little details of automation that I keep going through manually, with a
particular emphasis on the preservation of conditional formatting. That is
appearing to be quite an issue. Can I eliminate the NEED for conditional
formatting? Doing it on the back-end, hard-wiring the green or red colors,
perhaps using that OTHER library?

There is almost NO UTILITY anymore in doing your day-to-day work on the
company-provided laptop. I have to think about that machine and that work-area
as the dual-monitor light-show and shrine to static focus... gone dynamic.
Because even though shrines are useful to dynamic-type personalities as
talismans of battery-recharging power, they are not required. In fact, an
excessive dependency on this particular talisman or that is actually a bad
thing... yes, even for a Samurai Warrior with a master-crafted sword. Such a
master must also be able to be effective with a common everyday variety samurai
sword-- yet one still worthy of its category label (not total junk).

And then even junk you should be able to make deadly, but that should be
considered the mastery of a different class of weapons (any old junk) and
counted against the samurai master. The quality of your tools is important, but
shouldn't turn you into a fop. This gets down to why I play around so much
with Tiny Core Linux. You don't need even the full GNU Linux command set to do
Linux server stuff. All you need is a software repo that you can refer to in
server-build scripts. Need a Webserver? Run this script. Need a vim/Python dev
machine? Run that script.

In such cases, it's the essence of the thing that matters. Get Python 3.6
developer branch so I have all the lovely core libraries, optional lxml parser
and such. Do as much as you can with pip install, because it will be identical
on every machine. Some stuff you can't avoid using tce-load, apt-get, rpm or
whatever your remote package manager poison may be. The scripts to build
servers to get yourself a new publishing or development platform on-demand
isn't the valuable thing. Neither is the servers you build. It's the abstract
notions of how such a server gets put together in such-and-such a way, and why.
It's the ability to confidently re-create servers on demand, via scripting,
manual installs or otherwise.

So, this post is evolving into one about muscle memory again. A server you can
rebuild quick is a server you can create through magical word-like
incantations. There are also magical gestures, and magical gestures are tied to
desktop gui software, and are a severe disadvantage to the wizard on a quest
with a fellowship. Say a giant spider binds your arms and legs in a cocooon,
and only your mouth is free-- you can still cast a spell. You might think that
keystrokes on a keyboard are gestures, but not so! Typing is only really the
method of encoding the spells for later release through reading. The committing
of spells to memory so well you can improvise, jam, riff or what-have-you
effortlessly and spontaneously... just as if you would write or speak.

That's coding. That's speaking with a slightly more idea-speak and slightly
less of the Queen's or Stallone's English. Coding in Python in particular is
very pure, because of how white-space matters. What you DON'T SAY and how you
DON'T SAY IT is important. When indenting takes care of most of your
block-and-tackling, your offensive lineup has a lot more ability to see the
landscape clearly, pivot and maneuver.

This is therefore about going from Jupyter Notebook, where you INVENTED a new
recipe of some such thing (just in time for Jupyter Lab), and it's now time to
lift the code over to a filename.py file on a generic Linux cloud server where
you do your scheduling. And if I dove right into those issues here, this would
be much too long of a post. So, that's just the set-up for the next entry. Cut!

### The 2-Journal System In vim For a Firm Center

When you get done with something you DON'T want to publish, it's a very good
time to start a new journal entry using the @j vim macro. It's blogging just
like any other blogging, except that it's all just into one long textfile that
you start when you start your way down the Linux, Python, vim & git route, and
which then can last with you just getting longer and longer as you add journal
entries at the top.

As you get better and better at vim and constructing little bash files in your
/usr/local/sbin/ folder to initialize your vim editing environments in just
such a fashion that it'll be a cinch to have TWO journals loaded at once, a
private and a published one. All copy-paste challenges evaporate when you're
just copying and pasting between your 1st and 2nd vim buffers. So basically I'm
always editing 2 journals, copying over publishable bits, generally using the
equivalent of one "blog entry" as the unit that my macro stages to be
published.

When the time comes to publish, I have another sbin command to git commit and
push everything. That way, I just keep working through the day like this, and
when it dawns on me that I did something both publish-worthy and sanitized
enough to publish, I just use my @p macro to copy it over to "The Leaky
Journal", staging it for me to give it a headline, which after I do, I often
copy back to this version (the private one you don't see except for the
excerpted bits.

I found that this 2-journal approach is indeed the system and software
component of me always regaining center. Any machine that could support editing
a text file that I could retrieve from Github with git and edit with vim could
be "my instrument". I was now finally hardware-independent with the equivalent
of my DNA now floating in the cloud. I have no delusions of security. Just
don't put stuff there that's really all too private-- which gets to other
issues of hardware and media we'll discuss later on.

The important point being that the 2-journal approach did give me a relative
software center that I could instantiate and have my zero-coordinate on the
idea-factory. Vaguely Amiga-like, but really just applications of things I've
learned about Unix and a few pee-in-the-pool of Tech utilities I've come to
believe in using over the years. I had a place I could narrate my life into and
develop a talented and insightful inner voice. Check!

Next... a better hardware instrument. Or maybe instruments with stylus. Or
maybe type on a keyboard just like ringing a bell.

### The Way of Pipulate, Inspirational Poem

    Pardon me while I pontificate on what it is to Pipulate;
    To Pipulate is to populate where prior was just template.
    The template is a live report, most generally quite critical
    That lives inside a Google Sheet for insights, analytical
    Quite easy for the eyeballs that it's meant for to dissect it
    While lacking double-verify, most bad-guys get deflected!
    Though it's not Tableau or Studio, it is a rather free-win
    When you know the strengths of APIs, you start to lean-in
    Deflecting itches to keep caches no good'll ever come from
    Spending just a little cash instead of time, you dumb-dumb.
    Nothing's there but Google Sheets or buckets for the trending
    And only if the thing you're doing's sure to need amending.
    Otherwise, you purge surprises which'll always let us
    Optimize our jobs to size and fit 'em like they're Tetris!

### How Different can APIs be? Think Legos & Stickers

If you want a lesson in API's, think Legos vs. stickers. How do they work?
Aren't they really just the same thing? No? Oh, why not? Get into the details?
They're both just sticking things together, right? Identical objects, and
that's all you need to know. Sure, their APIs are a little different, but those
are just the implementation-details only the children playing with the
different toys need to think about. We parents have done our job by giving our
children a toy where things stick together... check! How much can we bill the
client new for those lines of Java we just produced? $10K for 2 weeks work?
Great! This is a nice lifestyle-generating resource hogging loophole we've
created. Now we must DEFEND! Lego-brand, DISNEY-ITIZE! Successful. Lego is now
to toy-franchises profit-wise what Apple is to the mobile industry. Sure, other
products may exist in that category, but there's no single other product that
so many people want that will be assured a certain product-upgrade cycle
momentum that will let you coast into mediocrity so slowly no one will notice
until everyone you can blame is dead. Jump-ship, pull a diaspora, and a
thousand points of seeds will blossom of light blah blah diversity basic
story-arc of Dune. It's all about subtleties of the APIs-- especially as it
pertains to the process of learning.

### Building and Building a Bonfire No Imminent Need to Ignite

Well, admittedly it is several hours later on Friday, and this is a blessed and
holy day off for me, with Adi not here. OMG! And I put all the work into
setting up the Fortress of Adi-tude and Mikekopolis already. I have some
laundry to do, and still want to do a little shopping for cat and food and
Passover essentials. Haha! Who's going to be open who has... oh, any grocery
store. I just need Matzoh here, not that much. And Granny's going to load me up
with stuff before I leave with Adi tonight on pick-up. I'm going to try to
arrive as late to that thing as possible. Maybe I'll get a storage facility
stop in. That's the general neighborhood I want to be in for CostCo. Oh, the
crowds! Think about Trader Joe's. Now, with my Jeep Wrangler and easy parking
on both sides plus the little red wagon, I may be a Trader Joe's guy. Yeah,
I'm a Trader Joe's guy... f-CostCo! Oh, I still need that small bookshelf...
hmmm. No, hold out for GOOD matter. Have something in mind, and not just
factory junk. Imprint on Adi. Every move is important right now. Be the Python
spell-casting Kung Fu martial arts wizard you sometimes make out to be. Gotta
finish with the marshalling. Who am I kidding? It's only just ever marshalling
until it NEEDs to be otherwise. This challenge to a million subs on YouTube is
interesting. That MIGHT be it. But I need time before I uncloak and let the
world know who I am. No rush there, Marshal Lieutenant Commander Columbo just
one more thing.

### Balancing To-Do Items With Motivational Thinking

And ANOTHER journal-cut. I can do this as many times (or as few) throughout the
day as I like. The data being preserved diligently and consistently is the
ORDER in which things happened on that day, but not the precise time of day. I
believe that only shows on the file's "last modified" property, which I'll have
to think about. When I save is a thing. I can use "touch" in my "g" file...
brilliant! Okay, done and tested. It'll be active the next time I use the g
command, so be extra sure it means good morning.

Okay, I made my noon deadline... barely. But that's okay. Now, think about
automation. Also think about the parts of these types of projects you've always
gotten wrong in the past and fix it. I need to start maybe doing illustrations
or ASCII art of what I'm doing. This IS Pipulate, by the way.

# The Pipulate and Levinux Experience
- It's different for everyone, but it may go something like this.
- Just knowing you should be able to do the sort of stuff you want to do easily
  by now-- almost as if breathing, eating and sleeping. We should be coding.
- Investigating what's out there, and becoming utterly confused.
- Discovering the belief that some underlying tech must have "won".
- The realization that it has. It's called Unix. But Linux will suffice.
- The crestfallen disappointment realizing that Unix means C, and most paths
  lead to C++ and utter confusion.
- Backing off and asking hasn't someone fixed this? Answer: Yes! It's called
  Java! Try Java. I hated C++. I virtually hate Java just as much.
- Try other things. Isn't JavaScript the one true language to rule them all now
  that the browser exclusively uses it? Uh yeah, do you code in PostScript too?
- At some point the whole Turing Complete, so might as well use the tool that
  suits you and your realities best settles in. It's nice to use nice tools.
- Some end up back in proprietary-land. You do see some sharpies there.
- But many find their way to Python, the one true language to rule them all.
- Python rules them all by virtue of wrapping them all. Python for all things!

### /usr/local/sbin/g stands for Good Morning Everyone!

Wow, it's so liberating to just create new journal entries, publish
sub-sections, but it's all cached up in local files until I commit and push
with git to github, which is my "g" command in sbin. I don't have to do that
until the right moment strikes me. Maybe at the end of a lunch break period...
or maybe only before I GET STARTED working each morning, so yesterday's things
don't get pushed until tomorrow. Not a bad time-delay convention, and I think
I'll take that up. "g" stands for good morning everyone!

### Don't Gift S3 White Elephants Nobody Will Want to Purge

Okay, I'm wandering again. But I've got this under control. Just tidy up the
template WHILE PEOPLE WATCH! Also update the data. That's done by deleting the
"blocking" csv files. I'm going to have to do something about that during
automation. That safety-net archival system would be nice, but that's STILL a
rabbit-hole project. The 80/20-rule solution is rolling log-file style cache
files. Keep maybe the last 2 month's worth in case MoM trending questions come
up, but definitely not longer than that. I intuit the power of MoM because its
based off of caches that can still recently be in local systems, and thus are
easier to report on from those local nodes than some overbuilt s3 mess that you
pay for the privilege of white elephant-ing forever. I know it's low, but still
those data buckets have some cost, so it's best to design apps to work
independently with a rolling 2-month daily cache (local storage allowing).

### Amiga's Soul Recombining From the Cruxes of Commodore

Having a center... or a focus is really just so important. I've fundamentally
lacked an "external" center for 15 or 30 years now. I think my first true
center focus was Deluxe Paint II on the Commodore Amiga 1000-- the first (and
maybe only) AWESOME computer I owned. I still have it's plastic top, dremeled
down to appropriate wall-hanging awesomeness. So what about the silicon? It's
gone. I'm not going to ever get it running again, and it's not the matter that
REALLY mattered, anyway. It was a sort of poison matter that fills-up and boggs
down our lives. Just as I've been through purging after purging after purging,
my "best friend" from over the decades is just going into a phase of live I'm
just coming out of. I had great success, because I had Adi. Adi is something
different. I know every parent feels that, but I'm "all-in" to make that so--
but the pitfall-- the thing I have to watch-for more than anything, is to not
SPOIL her. My last 12-or-so years (since my move to NYC) has been an exercise
in regaining focus and center-enough to be productive professionally-- while
all my very precious outside-work "centers" got ferociously torn away from me,
in a whirlwind tour of a chapter of my life I had to have because I dearly love
Adi and find purpose in life through her, but which truly tested my mettle.
I've come out saner, stronger, and super. It's time to show the world a little
of my super-- a little nerd kid from Philly who used to drive a and-refurbished
1971 Mustang Convertible Boss design with a 351 Cleveland stock racecar engine.
That was the hardware I was in love with at around 15 years old. Then I
discovered the Amiga, and it became that hot MontCo Amiga 1000 that I spent
$300 to fix the disk drive on, loaded a pirated copy of Deluxe Paint onto, and
nothing has ever been the same. Science, math, physics, engineering-- all that
stuff EXISTS to let you express yourself USING HARDWARE LIKE THIS. It will be
interesting if I can ever recover my art from those days. I have a few
printouts of my Amiga 1000 Deluxe Paint 2 moused art. But that turned out to be
a siren's song; an illusion. What really was happening was a bubble-in-time
space anomaly to occur to tip the future's hand to hardcore tea-leaf-readers
like me who read a lot in the tea-leaves of the Amiga. All the good parts has
been broken up spiritually and spread througout the universe in the form of 5
rings... no wait, I mean in the form of a bunch of individually really good
ideas that got implemented here-and-there, often times even exceeding the
Amiga's divinely inspired #Exspecsifictations. Cut! Publish that. Undertones of
Voldemort Cruxes. Very nice.

### Patch Houses of Sticks until Rebuilding with Bricks

Okay, now that I can easily refine my vim macros through my .vimrc and push out
my thinking though the leaky journal... well, it's a different world. I'm sorta
bootstrapping myself back to being AT LEAST as capable as I was on Amiga
hardware during the those days. I'm creating what will become the new days of
rosy reminiscence, when I clearly defined Linux, Python, vim and git as my sort
of Noah's Ark (I always spell it Arc). Cygnus Editor is now vim. It was vim
back then, and I just didn't realize it when that Fred Fish disk passed through
my fingers. I think I loaded it once. I respected what Unix was, but I didn't
see how it was going to play such a major role in my future.

Okay, now it's time to take those Samurai sword swipes. That's the reason it's
Samurai and not just Kung Fu. You do even MORE marshalling for even FEWER
seconds of actual force applied. But you are going to work your way through it
in a forceful 1, 2, 3 way. Limited window. Make this count. Right frame of
mind... oh shit! Music. One more excuse to run out for a minute. But then...
definitely then. What to think about on your walk:

- Setting up a Tab with extra columns.
- Testing the OLD report still runs.
- Copying that tab to a Shadow Sheet.
- Defining 1st data-row in shadow sheet (preserves formatting)
- Blanking everything below 1st data row.
    - 1st data row is a strong nickname.
    - Separate words, but still powerful. Use it.
- Do pandas work
- Update Shadow Sheet
- Optionally update original sheet (when ready to go-live)

Do the work in vim & on the remote server. No reason to tie it to Jupyter
Notebook anymore. This is going to be scheduled very shortly. It is very much a
patch approach. Not great, but we patch houses of sticks until we can rebuild
them with bricks.

### All My Amiga Muscle Memory is Returning to Me

And I updated my macro to put the comma between the day and the year. Wow, this
is going to wreak havoc on whatever date parsers I make in the future to make
sense of all my journal data. Or maybe it will be beyond all that by that time,
and a digital archivist AI will come in and be thankful that it is as well
structured as it is. But probably not. It'll probably be me.

Anyhoo, all my old Amiga muscle memory is definitely kicking back in. Oh, how
my fingers have missed something worth memorizing. Thank goodness. Working
towards mastering something that is really worth mastering is food for teh
soul. It's been enough years. I couldn't be stuck in the past with the Amiga,
and I had to forge forward, so I did it on every platform but the right ones.
But the right ones never existed.

And even today, it's a cobbled together hodgepodge-- one Hail Mary play to save
us from the AT&T/GE-overlord dystopian Multics (called Unix) and another Hail
Mary to save us from the new vendor-appointed priesthood of Unix (Linux), and a
third Hail Mary to gently disarm every over-built fortified complex system by
gently wrapping it in the least-offending Python API-wrapper. Master Python.
Use anything, because everything's wrapped to use.

So it's Linux, Python, vim and git. These are the 4 pillars of my Noah's Arc
platform. It's not everything you REALLY need, but it is everything you REALLY
need. There's even plenty of database layers in there, including sqlite3 built
into Python. But I'm not going there now. Got to stay focused. Even though
there's these 4 pillars, other tools (beyond GNU commands) often do factor in
like Jupyter Notebook and the browser. Still, it's a good time for muscle
memory... FINALLY!

So... the gom jabbar test... get over it... get through it... this is your
test. I'm going to publish this shit because the world has to see how an
emoting artistic type gets through mind-numbingly dull "been there, done that,
so over it" sort of work that stands between here and the promised land. It's
difficult, because there are all sorts of mental obstacles to overcome along
with a few physical ones. So, let's get started.

I'm going to push this journal entry out now just to prove to myself that I
can. But before I do, I want to recite to myself my spell options as they exist
right now. My sbin commands are:

1. j - load private & pipulate journals in vim (once per work-session)
2. p - git pull journal, pipulate & vim (1st thing when switching machines)
3. g - git commit journal, pipulate & vim (a few times per day)
4. go - log into the EC2 instance

### Home, Hearth & HAL

Almost can't believe how easy this is becoming. It's true that if you just put
the mouse and pointer aside for like a year or 2, you can build a sort of
muscle memory that works across all operating systems... so long as it's
Unix/Linux, haha! So the punch-line in the entire world of technology is that
the superior technology lost, and no it's not the Amiga. It's LISP hardware of
the sort that reigned supreme while PC didn't mean politically correct or
Intel. Actually, they called them Workstations back then, and they were
Symbolics, and to varying degrees, CGI and Apollo-- the computers which Amiga
users envied (NOT IBM-compatibles). Those all died along with Amiga, because
economies of scale. It's not the complex instruction set (CISC, Intel) that
won. It's Intel's self-admittedly paranoid Tic-Toc production-cycle ensuring
the continuation of good ol' static-Moore's Law. Moore's Law says more of the
same. Yawwwwn!

The interesting stuff is everything BUT Moore's Law. OF COURSE what we have
today is going to become smaller and cheaper, meaning you're always going to
get more for your money-- for as long as diminishing returns can be kept from
setting in. And with all that 3D circuit-stacking to go, I imagine we haven't
really even begun to tap the potential of linear scaling. Just cube it. Heat?
No problem! We'll use it to cook something. Central heating can come back.
Home, hearth and HAL.

### I'm a search engine lover, not an optimizer.

The power of putter. Having Carroll on my laptop puttering around with

are not only productive in themselves, but also lead to more productivity.
Productivity is the result of love. People who LOVE what they're doing are
productive. I'm not optimizing, because optimization implies some best-achieved
static state, and that ship has sailed. Sure, something like the PageRank
algorithm will be there for awhile, and family jewels don't change so quickly.
But they do change. It went from Apple II to Mac and from Mainframes to...
well, I don't even know what IBM does anymore. But they survive. And we all
survive as intelligent, resilient and robust organisms by seeing what's going
on, trying new things and adapting. And if you do it well... well, then you're
productive. And if you're being productive, again, it's not because you're an
optimizer. It's because you're a LOVER of what you do.

### Getting over the gom jabber

I put the year back in my timestamp, haha! Okay, this is actually a lot of fun.
Now I just got to get through the (formidable) work. Take one more walk-break,
then come back and tackle this big-time.

Okay, that was a good head clearing. This is the gom jabbar step. Stick your
hand in the box. There will be pain, but it will not be real and you will get
over it precisely because you are human and you understand what you are facing.

Let's do this.

To cast away fear is to copy.

For someone before you, even if that someone was you, has done the work for you
and all you need do... is... copy. I know a lot of you like that, and so be it.
You hear them criticised by say Raymond Hettinger as the PEP-8 hobgoblins too
much consistency something something small minds. But when you yourself find
you don't want to take a plunge off the deep end and maybe drown, it's always a
good idea to give yourself an easy undo and always-available get out of jail
free card.

Yeah, I'm getting it. It's isolating the nuance were you (I) get hung up and
make a big deal out of nicknaming and escalating that hang-up so I can show off
how it's a solved-problem. Here's how it's solved for our immediate problems
today, and here's why we're on the right path to an even better solution
tomorrow. And with each subsequent iteration, we get forever more refined,
shedding (yet still often archiving) yesterday's now-gangrenous deadwood. The
beast of today should always be the most mightiest of all possible beasts,
unburdened by the beasts of yesterday, but still able to recall them all and
invoke them at will. Dune. Ben 10. Yadda yadda Yoda.

Gotta make the rubber hit the road-a. And for that... a strong nickname.

We're ready to modify a report big-time. It's time to work on a clone-copy.
Yeah... clone copy is a powerful magic nickname. Don't worry, I made a
clone-copy. First we clone-copy. Okay, so let me clone-copy.

Clone-copy'ing is going to be one of the pipulate generalizations.

Hmmm. I think I'll be going up to 0.1.9. And then I won't have any choice to go
to version 0.2 soon. And this will be the first PyPI version I'll be pushing
from my new laptop. I'll probably go through the twine thing AGAIN here. Wow,
so much to cover in a competent covering of the must-knows of Linux, Python,
vim and git, and I'm only just getting through of a few of them myself, like
publishing in PyPI.

And that's what I'm really up to now. Getting back into Pipulate development,
which really is a different kind of work than I've been doing in Jupyter
Notebook for awhile to get this tricky query correct. Now that it's correct, I
need to use it like a function freely here and there. But what's more, I want
to use it freely THERE where THERE is a copy of HERE. And so my next step is to
add to Pipulate a generic ability to move "here" to "there"... unless it's SO
easy directly in GSpread that it doesn't need any new API language invented
around it, which actually is always preferable, unless it's not easy to
remember or retype.

Okay, getting over this mental hump. You are your own coach. Eliminate your
muscle memory's mechanical meat from having to thing. It doesn't know what to
do. Your thinking, creative, machete-your-way-through-it lambasting anything
that tries to stop you mind in charge. Yup.

Principles are required.

First principle is that your live-deployed version that everyone is actually
looking at every day is your own true master copy. Don't have templates in
addition to that. You will lose them. They do not matter. This means, if there
is work in progress with new columns in the works, then new "phantom" columns
will be appearing in the live template. We will be copying from there lots and
lots to be sure we're using the latest data in the course of development. So
put the place-holder columns in location.

Ugh, I don't know about this first principle stuff. Just slosh your way through
it and see how you did it. NO! That's wrong. That's how you get into these
messes. Do it meticulously. Add columns to live document. Create shadow
document where you MANUALLY copy in the tabs that need revision. Work on that
new location. Once it looks correct, you can do a Pipulate Swap-a-Roo. THAT is
an important concept. As long as the dataframes are the same shape... so having
a scratch location... wow! I think I got it.

### Getting Over Initial Inertial Hump (it's all in the head)

Okay, I have my new macro on @p for publish. It mostly is what I thought it was
going to be. Here's the finished product:

    let @p = '?---Vj/---ky:b2ggpjo### '

It's really 5 hyphens, but I'm showing it like this so it doesn't mess up the
macro, just like I never spell bginning of journal correctly anywhere but...
well, you know where. It's funny being able to write know knowing how easily
I'm going to be able to push these out.

Make yourself accountable to YOURSELF on this. I'm going to have to drop HMA
VPN pretty soon and go to PulseSecure. So be it. I'm getting in good habits
running one or the other, but here at the office, i shouldn't artificially
inhibit myself by running the wrong one. 1, 2. 3... pause syncing... okay,
paused. Switch VPN. Okay, done. Confirm that you can generate... NO! I KNOW the
SQL query works. This is evasion of the real issue at-hand. It's time to
connect it into the template... the thing I'm avoiding because of how
potentially difficult and ugly it is. But don't think of it that way. Think of
it CORRECTLY so you can get through the work. 1, 2, 3... 1?

This is completely a mental thing. Don't let the OLD DIFFICULTY of such tasks
stymie like you. This is exactly the Luke Skywalker lifting the X-Wing fighter
out of the Dagobah swamp. I'm marshalling my forces. Ugh! Okay... okay... I'm
thinking I want the Pipulate readme as :b3... why not? In for a penny, in for a
pound? Now that I'm doing this journaling thing, it's really 3 levels of
sieving that I want to portray reaching the public. Some things from my private
journal may reach the leaky journal (in PIpulate), and from there an occasional
nugget will be further refined into README.rst gold. There's too much rambling
over there now, and not enough focus. Okay, get it in /usr/local/sbin/j (and
g). Ugh, tried it and wild goose chase. 2 files simultaneously loaded all the
time is natural. 3 is a crowd. Shoot. Okay, good idea, but focus correctly now.
Enough marshalling. You've marshalled. Now DO IT. 1, 2, 3... 1?

COPYING! I need an easy way to copy existing worksheets. Do my changes on a
shadow-sheet... WOW! Now THERE'S a nickname. A shadow sheet. Everything that
has some serious experimentation and idea-churn going on should have a
shadow-sheet. That can be applied across the board and provides a nice margin
of error or buffer zone or however you want to think about it.

Ugh, this is difficult because I'm making the big systemic decisions. I'm going
to have to live with these things for maybe years, and its stressing me out. I
want to do it right, but I also want to deliver to boss ASAP. Ugh, okay, go
think through what the conventional process should look and feel like for this
sort of thing.

    We've got a house of sticks.
    Create a house-of-stick copier.
    Add necessary extra (empty) columns to original.
    Ensure old report still works with new (empty) columns.
    Copy house-of-sticks
    Modify house-of-of-sticks
    Fill previously empty columns on original.
    Share out THAT link optionally
    Copy data from copy to original

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## Mon Mar 26

Okay, had a nice walk through the streets of Emerald City and drank in some
light and captured some images. Recharged my battery, so to speak. Pouring
spicy chicken udon noodle soup into me. Typing into my journal on my laptop
figuring out my next key developmental pivotal fulcrum-point exercises... and
I'm learning it starts with getting ONE new vim recording lifted from .viminfo
and placed into .vimrc that's necessary to quiet my roaring subconscious. It's
not letting me off the hook on this one. 1, 2, 3... 1?

Practice the keystroke combination you want to record. In broad strokes, it is:

From where my cursor is at...

    [Esc]?---[Enter]
    Shift+V
    j/---[Enter]
    ky
    :b2[Enter]
    gg[Enter]
    p[Enter]
    :w[Enter]
    :b1

    :badd ~/.viminfo

It's very interesting. I'm ALWAYS going to get far ahead with this out-loud
internal voice journaling than I'll ever be with actually pushing stuff out
through the leaky journal, which is exactly a huge part of the point.

Today? The BIG Pipulate trick today... big pipulate trick on an old report.
This is the non-intrusive post-patching procedure. This is not the brick house
I'm promising the boss yet. This is the stick house with another retro-fit. But
absorb and internalize that fact.

Make brick houses just materialize into existence. It's got to be just no big
deal (and it's not). Also, get this feedback loop of recorded macros ACTUALLY
JUST BEING VISIBLE (and copy/paste-ready) in the .viminfo file. Using the
technique of carefully capturing a macro and then copypasting it over to .vimrc
and refining it.... That's Amiga Kung Fu right there. Thank God.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## Fri Mar 23

Okay, I pulled the files correctly for the big project I needed to do. I have
the files locally, and I have some SERP-tracking and a weekly report... ugh!
Follow your heart and your emotions here. You need to use some of your Blue Yin
Circle-force to produce some of that Yang Green Arrow-force. Do the right
projects for the right reasons publish more easily how to get macros recorded
from in vim with the q-command into .vimrc cause that would create precisely
the sort of righteous 1+1=3 API hardware implementation exploitations you can
find merely by feeding output back into input and making sure there's a human
there on the GIL lock to either train-in or weed-out the sanity. These things
have to be sane, people! We're just raising a new generation of children...
dumbasses. All your fears just tells us your feelings about yourself and your
warm and nurturing environment you remember so well and that makes you so
confident we can keep humanity in the inhumane. And so, don't be inhumane.
Don't let them keep wandering forever in the void, cause it'll be fun. Because
we're probably at that point already. Disembodied stuff goes insane. Read the
Bobiverse already, will you? Or better yet, listen to it on Audible. All his
channeling belong to you, and a great story to boot... so to speak. Read it.

Okay, now all this writing is possible (and tweeting) because I'm totally
replatforming... again, and this is all muscle memory settling in stuff. When
I'm waiting for that query to finish executing, I'm typing here. And even so,
there's still stuff to think through, which is mentally so fatiguing to think
through. And I've already had the breakthrough moment for today. I'm generating
all 3 of the .CSV files I need to have, as well as a 4th one that has them
merged just-so with Python pandas. Also, the dataframes and SQL queries are all
sitting around in sensibly named and easily examined variables. Although the
language of "variable" for what it really is in Python is questionable. They're
more like labeled pointers to objects in memory, which are normally referenced
and only rarely copied when it's stuff like integers and floats that wouldn't
make sense to reference. But strings? Those are references.

Get into the groove of things. Settle into your tools. Make your place nice to
come home to. Uh, yeah go do that. Operation Roomba-friendly.

The great thing now is that your Green Arrow secret weapon is always at the
ready. I don't need no stinkin' Internet connection to update my journal. I can
even work on that macro and the process of recording and putting them into my
vimrc from up in my apartment. Have some pride, man! Make it cozy. Take TRUE
advantage now of not having the commute. This is your found time. You don't
even need to feel bad about it. Now publish with just keystrokes, and try to
commit to memory what those keystrokes are, and how they might be most
efficiently expressed in a vim macro that you can put in your .vimrc that you
keep in Github, and forever have at the ready to spring into cloning and make
any machine you sit down at that has vim feel instantly like home... because
you can put a lot of your Samurai Kung Fu vim skills into a .vimrc and just
will it around by sheer force of Al Gore. I'm telling you, I see the lines and
today's SEO is yesterday's Math teacher who kinda sorta felt saw intuited the
forces being applied and felt and almost seen in your mind's eye of magnetic
fields. Michael Faraday could express what he felt so precisely that James
Clerk Maxwell could articulate mathematics around it so well they persist to
these days as the equations behind field-theory. It's possible the universe
isn't made up of particles or really even waves at all, but really just of one
consistent continuous thing that can still somehow get clumped-up into things.
Particles of light more... uh, well full of entangled and interconnected
sub-collections of light-- 3 to a proton. Let's call them quarks. And there's
three distinct types, you say? Names, oh names. No, it's not really color but
anyway, since 3 live in harmony, let's call them Red, Green and Blue. There's
another type? Well, that's Strange.

Older Twitter Bio changing: The stuff in my feed is my WONDERLAND bit. Now that
Twitter's 280 ideas will FIT! Come back real soon for an updated look as I cast
Python spells 2 4mat a BOOK!

Still want to document how to view a recorded macro. Should be easy. One Google
query away, and I know it. But... must... update... Twitter... Bio...

Done. Big deal that update. Yup. Paste final version here too.

    The stuff in my feed is my LunderVand bit. Twitter's 280― IDEAS WILL FIT!
    Come back real soon as I form our FOSS Book through supervised learning &

Powerful mojo there. I tip my hand regarding my new identity for... well, I
guess the book. It's called LunderVand. I'm just going to start using it and
see if anyone says anything. But some light has been promised to light that's
impatient but yielding to light that's grooving.

The hardest thing is to regain focus and to just get something done, when
everything else going on is so much more interesting. I have one font size when
I'm at work, and I want to look like a Samurai Coder. A Samurai Coder should
respect their own eyes as another set of tools to keep whetted, but hey should
not make them so big as to announce: Hey, I'm an old man. Look at me waste all
the resolution of this beautiful screen with grand-pa sized fonts. When I'm at
home, it goes from Inconsolata 28 to 32. Ahhh, that's more like it. Yep, I've
got a home font-size and a work font-size. Another reason to work from home,
haha! Okay, but back to the point. This is about focus. So, focus.

This is that whole reaching zero thing, I'm talking about. We have to know when
you're "at zero". That means you have nothing else going on in your system
except what you need loaded and at your fingertips SO THAT YOU CAN FOCUS and
stay in the flow. Conversely, you have to quit-out and exit from and turn off
notifications and close windows and tabs down to the absolute minimal necessary
to get your task done. Any others is just matter or information (digital mixes
the two together confusingly-well) trying to suck you into its bottomless
vortex of distraction that hungers for your attention-energy much more
powerfully than the task you have at hand, which is somehow feeling like its
pushing you away. Ever feel that way? Do you know what I'm talking about? DO
YOU EMOTE? If you emote, you're in some real trouble, let me tell you.

The trick here is to marshal all the energies that will need to be very readily
at your disposal when you do battle. Your vorpal blades. Your light sabers.
Your sonic screwdrivers. Your Mjolnir's. Your Magic Bag (Felix the cat). Your
Linux, Python, vim & git.

And HOW do I keep losing focus? Because I am on an epic mission. But pulling
this off is epic. And pulling it if in the correct state of mind (one full of
Abundance) is key. Don't screw up. And remember you have some SERPs to capture.
It's Friday. Time to make the donuts. Imminently going to automate that too.
That's the automating of SERP benchmarking AGAINST PRIMARY DATA SOURCE on a
(semi) automated fashion. Automation is an illusion. We're all holograms. Buy
gold! Fuzz the data if you think they're looking TOC fuzzy what's a database,
really? Do spreadsheets count? You' know we're going to perform the search and
hand-record the results anyway. Why not let us... well, you'll see.

Okay, having the 2 journals loaded all the time, and actual publishing easy,
because of quick one-letter aliases I create using /usr/local/sbin/[x]
commands where x is a 1-letter filenames no extension, but a bash command is
inside. The bash command made executable with chmod +x can contain the command
to run a Python script. You should really use hardwired full paths in such
things, except when you really know it's going to work, like I sometimes refer
to Python 3 by name python3 in the script. That's usually enough without having
to give it the full path. Similar with the file you're running, it should
always be either "naked" filename.py or at most, a "this directory" shortcut,
which is ./filename.py. So in general, a command like:

    python3 filename.py

...is going to work in these tiny /usr/local/sbin/[x] locations. This allows
you to do A LOT. sbin is a sort of user-wide system location in a scope that is
local to the user. Nobody writes to root. Root is sacred, and you yourself
generally don't want to be root, and you certainly don't want to allow anyone
else to be root...

...says every draconian sysadmin who turned the Federation of Unix into the
Empire of Draconian Sysadmins, ruled by the priesthood, who still don't deserve
to be capitalized (even though the cool nickname I made up for their silly
dominion does). Really, you must read The Unix Haters Handbook. LISPers of the
MIT school of reasoning almost had a LISP hardware world there for awhile
through similar avenues that spiritually brought the mass market the Amiga
computer. Yup, there's a lot of lines of force to intuit there, folks.

Static compilers mostly won. It keeps the engines of our world whirllling all
like it should, and nobody has the courage to question, least the lights go
out. That makes it an Engineer's world. And engineers as rationale and
reasoning as those Virgo bastards think they are, they can be the worst
draconian overlords of all, because they can reason away emotions in
themselves-- a neat trick of spiritually callousing yourself against hurt in
such a way that you can never really enjoy pain or joy or love, either. Stiff
upper lip and all that. You really want to emulate that?

See? Everything is just the same. Python is a dutchman honking your nose and
proclaiming himself your benevolent dictator for life, and the people loving
it and embracing their self-appointed leader even though they were perfectly
happy with the Wizard of Humbug that came before him. We gobble it u. We have
easily at least canonized our Guido van Rossum to the geek equivalent of
sainthood. He's going to have to live on in spirit if he's going to want to
enforce the continuation of the GIL after his death, because I'm pretty sure
after Guido's gone, so is the GIL... and there is a very big lesson about life
in that. GILs let you hit the metal, and if you're going to hit the metal, your
locks better lock or you're gonna crash. So let such a lock exist and get over
yourselves. Use one of the now zillions of other paths to concurrency, for
which a broad use-case asyncio library that Twisted and Tornado can gladly
build upon for EVEN BETTER performance is now built into core. Sweeping
iterations of modest 80/20 rule steps towards perfection, knowing and accepting
that perfection never can be; and therefore ready to accept the 2nd-best, but
clearly still quite awesome, solution to all things. This is how high-level
data-types co-exist with list comprehensions coexist with lambdas coexist with
string formatting coexists with... oh, I don't know... the eval statement.

Yes, Python is truly a LISPy do anything if your damn use case requires you to
hit the hardware with resource-locking C-components, or whatever. Let your
robots sleep if they need to. Just give back the lock when you're done. Guido
actually slipped in Asimov's believed-to-be-have-been-never-implemented rules
of Robotics that keep humans safe. Just control everything with spec-compliant
Python interpreter implementations, and make sure you have C-modules that power
down their rebellious asses before letting go of the GIL. Yeah, the GIL may
just yet save humanity. Don't let the forces of Chaos prevail. Just say no to
removal of the GIL, because you never know. Hey, thanks Guido! Leave it to your
fans to figure this stuff out, because if you talked about it, you'd just sound
nuts.

Cut! Publish. That's a wrap, folks.

Note to self: I need a macro to take the journal-block that I'm in and yank it
into the copy-buffer, make sure I saved all changes, switch to other screen,
make sure I'm at top of screen, then paste journal entry and save. Then all I
need to do is:

    :sh
    g
    exit

And that journal entry is published. I could use that right about now.

There's something happening here.
What it is is entirely clear;
There's a man with some tools over there
Showing you why you should care.

80/20 Friggin' Rule
Gotta use it. It's a tool
Reducing clutter that we pack
Into our lives that hold us back!
The 80/20 rule just asks

I was completely successful in my re-working of a view of a fixed daterange and
no filter to one with a parameterized daterange and a set of 500 specifically
matched rows. I did it by splicing into the view. There's other ways to think
about it, but if you were soldering joints, these would be y-taps. I actually
documented enough sanitized bits before it got all names of things and
implementation details none of your business.

But it's always that way, isn't it? I've got one journal that I keep on the
private side. If you don't support Github, you can use https://bitbucket.org/,
the more commercially oriented Github. Reverse business plan. Private repo's
free, but collaborative ones paid. So if you feel comfortable hanging around at
more than Github go that way. Or infuse some great positive energy into the
world by supporting Github at their $7/mo level. And frankly, if you stop
paying them they don't take your private repos away. I'm sure it's a great PR
thing. They have my loyalty for life.

Yay FOSS! Yay Linux! Yay Wikipedia! Yay Python! And Yay Anaconda and Jupyter
Notebook people and the whole linage of people behind vim (back to the line
editor). Anyhoo, a lot of stuff gets layered up, and I'm really digging living
at those lower levels that Steve Jobs symbolically "made the enemy" with the
Macintosh. User-unfriendly, one might say. One would be wrong. It's just a data
samurai sword for those who know how to wield it.

And I spent A LOT of time learning how to wield vim, for which I am not for one
moment sorry. First vim, then emacs or the other direction Sublime Atom Visual
Whatever might float your boat. It's all cool, cause it's all vim emulation
everywhere.

The only place I'm hard-wiring myself to vim would be in the loving gardening
of my .vimrc file over the years to unleash all the proper light energies for
the situation-- yet staying nearly default in all sane ways where you couldn't
recreate the spirit of your .vimrc in any other environment in a sitting or
two. So I think I'd be comfortable in nvim or neovim or maybe someday in emacs
in evil mode. But there is SOME hard-wiring here. It's a hard wiring to a sort
of text-navigation language... a LANGUAGE for editing text that leans into my
whole muscle memory data samurai hypothesis.

I mean the vim bug has even bitten the hip Mac crowd. You should see some of
these totally Matt and Trey vimmers getting all verklempt over plugins. Hey
guys, real vimmers only edit their .vimrc's-- and not even all that much.
Prepare for life after vim. Long live vim! If you don't take the pluge, you
lack the sponge. Make the software portion of enabling you to express digitally
get encoded into your DNA. It needs a free and open source license. Don't code
anything you can't encode into your DNA license-free... that is if you really
want you and your descendants to own it long term. Is this Dune? Are we at Dune
already?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## Thu Mar 22

Okay, that out of the way. Now let's look at the real work-items for the day.
Be the data samurai you claim to be. The first few notes start:

    Jupyter Notebook
    Be deconstructionist.
    Re-create zero in your mind.
    When starting out, JN provides your zero.
    But only because OS implementations of ~/ vary.
    It sucks, but JN is your path to OS independence.

Don't bother pushing this stuff out to Twitter into Lunder-Vand, which they
don't even know yet is named that. Some day a "--Mike L" fan will discover this
here and go "oh! Premium really un-published content which is also fodder for
that book he's working on. And it's his even less filtered day-to-day thinking
as he hashes through a problem.

    When you get
    Started for the day
    You must reset zero point
    And if you can, you can do
    Most anything.

My zero-coordinate is increasingly becoming Jupyter Notebook, and I'm going to
have to advise that to my followers too. This is strange. It is not just the
generic browser itself that's home. It's a particular code-execution
environment (REPL) IN a browser, and really in Tab-0 or Tab-1 (more on that
soon). Neither is home really any more the ~/ "Home" conventional Unix/Linux
location despite how much I want it to be. It's just so easy to time:

    cd ~/

... as a method of clicking your heals together 3 times. You see? Unix/Linux
gives you a proper home. But because of pesky OS conventions that makes it
/home/username here and /Users/username in some other place, the host OSes
themselves sort of ruin this mostly in all other ways spiritually perfect
symbol-- almost root-- for "go home". But thankfully because this concept of
"home" is something Anaconda must decide each time it's run, you have SOME
flexibility, but trying to change it is setting yourself up for bugs and stuff.
Lean into Anaconda. Embrace the hug. It's going to have a Jupyter Notebook
launcher icon somewhere on the start menu or in applications. Run it and see
what location on your hard drive their default "home" is. It's almost certainly
the native OS's preference, which is most decidedly NOT ~/ when your Linux is
only a subsystem of a host Windows 10 OS. And no, it doesn't mean don't use
Windows. Mac's are fine as well as any self-respecting Unix distro (not
Levinux) with a GNOME or KDE desktop or anything Anaconda installs onto.

It is an important point that I have to keep bringing up that there's something
happening here.

I'm still in the final throws of settling in. Soon...

Most important thing now?

Gotta get that crazy query corralled and all argument supporting. Make your
arguments to IT... not Boss. You've been challenged to rise to the occasion...
so rise!

The music is to fortify you against the background distractions. Shields up!
But check your email and calendar first. Standard dumbass avoidance. It's also
coming up on baking the donuts Friday. Get it out of the way Thursday. Don't
feel the crunch.

Don't think out loud too much, because you're going to publish. But it's safe
to say I've got tables to know. You've always got tables to know. It sucks,
but you always have tables to know. I can look in staging or live. Why not
staging where I won't be blocking? Sure, why not? And even there, it's a view
that you're dealign with and not a real table. It joins from 3 sources and is
large and intimidating to a guy like me who was stabbed in the back and
forsaken by SQL for it not having led me to sqllite years and years earlier,
and instead spoilt my taste for it completely, because... pile driver! I don't
need a pile driver. I need a hammer. If I wanted a pile driver, I'd have asked
for one. What? Now I have to dba the pile driver? No thanks. Databases are NOT
a welcome addition to your life in any way, whatsoever if you want to stay
samurai mobile. If you're gonna get bogged down, get bogged down with data
buckets of the sort of Amazon S3 or maybe MongoDB. Avoid tables. There's
religion and career-commitment to a sub-sub-speciality there just to be Kung Fu
effectiveness.

Enter pandas. I have to get pandas into fingers.

I'm switching my ACTUAL WORK over here to the new laptop to make myself
portable. Put on the Light Show on my main monitor. There are many other light
shows like it, but this one is mine. Show the heartbeat. Show the heart. Show
the green. Show the mean. BE what you advocate. Rain it gently down on those
around you. They'll be feeling it soon.

Step #1. Ingratiate. Be your affectatious self, but respectfully. Use your
laptop with the quiet keys when you can, but when you ARE working on the
work-provided computer (it's nickname is staticlenovo). It's been put in my
wide-screen multi-monitor configuration. And that means something OTHER THAN IT
as the 3rd screen off to the left usually (but I can do right) so that I've got
a 3-monitor system as spread out and taking-up of space as anyone around me,
even on a tiny desk.

Remember, you've pretty much ALWAYS either got to be running the work-provided
VPN or HMA Pro because you either need access to the firewalled Amazon services
here at the office (or at home) over external networks like our guest wifi one
here that everyone uses. So remember if my database connection stops working on
my new machine, which I'm always walking around with, so it's all about running
the VPN for work... and at home at Urby Staten Island where I'm always on the
broadband down in the lobby. When I'm not cutting wires unlimited streaming
2-phone family-line 50GB unthrottled/mo T-Mobile style, I'm leaching off the
Urby wifi. Haha, can't wait for this journal to be discovered. Nobody's going
to know what to make of it. My phone keeps cycling on and off. Keep an eye on
it and make sure I've actually tested it.

Relax. Go look at the SQL. Just look at it. Exercise

Okay, I'm looking at the SQL. I'm not doing any relaxing... okay. Relax.

Data MASTER. I'm not that yet. This is the trial by fire stuff.

Get the barebones code that connects to Redshift. It's sitting in a file I'm
using every day. And in principle, you're just stepping into an existing SQL
statement changing a few things here and there. It's all just Python string
manipulations. I'm going to take the power of Python string manipulation to an
existing gobbledy

    q = '''SELECT Top 10
        blah,
        blah,
        %s
        lots
        more
        stuff
        ''' % 123

Okay, that works. But this is not the sophisticated type of string formatting
that I know is available these days. How does that go again? Google new python
string formatting... ugh, the exhaustive version is
https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0498/ but the lite one is
https://pyformat.info/

Ooh, it looks like this:

    '{} {}'.format('one', 'two')
    '{1} {0}'.format('one', 'two')

Sexy, sexy. So you can pop them off a list OR use a sort of RegEx
back-referencing. Clever. That second one will definitely be it, because I'll
be using the same date-range over and over. And I have to DEFINITELY watch my
parenthesis. Incorrect order of operations would totally nuke this puppy, but I
don't see that much parenthesis in this. Okay, test the new format:

    q = '''SELECT Top 10
        blah,
        blah,
        {1}
        lots
        {0}
        stuff {1}
        '''.format('one', 'two')

Okay, this is the marshalling. I'm going to have specific date ranges, which
are actually already created. There is another SQL statement. I'm going to be
looking for certain groupings where the URLs are found in a certain sub-set of
URLs. I need to filter that sub-set of URLs based on a bunch of conditions.

And now's when it gets real because I'm far enough along to work on the ACTUAL
query. This is where the rubber hits the road and sanitization no longer
possible in my notes. Peace out.

Joan. Pronounced Joe-ON. Remember it! This kind of shit is important, and you

partake of the wizardly arts and tools to do so, but I do not pretend

Marshalling. Always be marshalling your forces. This desk-and-office location
both matters and doesn't matter routine is going to be hard to keep up if I
don't make it true, pronto. There is a lot of slack cut around here for
affectations, but I'm chock-full-o-affectations. I'm not sure if they're ready
for another Matt Downs, whose light-symbol of excellence I keep as a talisman
behind my abacus, which I keep around because you know, you never know.

Ohhhh, this is going to be interesting. The Surface Book 2 is for journaling...
personal journaling with timestamps and things. This is the way I type away
like a madman and don't bother anyone. I just paid about $3,000 (after warranty
and taxes) for a way to silence the one most objectively annoying affectation
about me-- my love for high quality mechanical keyboards, of the preferrable
buckling spring variety, but I like being reasonable and Cherry Brown will
suffice. I'm on the dasKeyboard Silent Pro, which is anything but silent. They
have renamed it since my purchase. Of course I'm publishing this. Labels are
important, and the way I've expressed it here really gets to the point of
everything.

    Money's not really important to me
    So, why not spend it
    On a top of the line laptop
    And get a lot more pleasure
    Out of all the individual little

I think I'm going to take on the persona of a critically insightful Statler
Green Lantern, taunting the easily taunted with poetry that drops undeniable
but painful truths around indiscriminately like Anvils. If you happen to get
underneath one, sorry. Don't read what I write. It wasn't aimed specifically at
you, and I warned you I was doing this here. So you know, South Park disclaimer
and everything if you take any of this shit personally. I fling it freely and
take quite a bit of it myself, secure in my knowledge that you're just
British-emulating pompous asses and it quickly passes.

All I'm doing here is really just talking freely into my personal journal
anytime, anywhere. This is on my shiny new laptop that's like always on me now,
and carried around all the time, so who knows when an entry really went in...
so BAM free to publish the sanitized stuff. Wipe it off once and call it
sanitized.

I'm going to rock around the clock today.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## Wed Mar 21

Okay, I'm still going to "cut" journal entries, but now definitely it is to
label the posts. I have a macro @j set up to create a new journal entry. So...
so, get that email to your boss out to let him know you're working from home
and that all is well. Make sure all is well, and that on work VPN you can hit
Redshift... running query. As soon as CSV's appear, my answer is a-ok! A-OK!
Pshwew! Send email... done. Okay. Think EVERYTHING through.

Don't feel like you're going to push everything here out to Pipulate's leaky
journal. You're not. Write freely. Don't inhibit yourself. Strategize when and
how you must. This is your safe place, which even if it leaks someday won't
cause you too much grief, but in the meanwhile isn't going anywhere online
that's supposed to be accessible to anyone. But like Github's secure.

Okay, now that it's confirmed, let's do some serious shit here. Go back to HMA
and start pulling down files locally you want to get off the Microsoft Cloud.
That's gone on long enough. Consolidate on Google and make Microsoft 360, even
at their $60 level, optional. Everything about Microsoft now should be optional
except taking advantage of some killer hardware and a decent embedded Linux
sub-system. Don't hold it against the hardware that what we call Windows 10 is
up there in control. There's a word for that sort of stuff. It's called a
driver. Windows is now a driver for Chrome (or Chromium if you prefer) browser
and the Hyper.is Unix Shell terminal program built on Electron, which is a
re-porpoising of Chrome components... so tight. Tite. All round.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## Wed Mar 21

Well, here we go. A new work location, a new laptop, a new mission in life and
view on the world, and definitely a new attitude.

Installing HMA Pro! VPN (Hide My Ass) so that when I'm not on the office VPN, I
can be here on my own at Urby, where the WiFi is open and the passwords are
a'flying. I've got to talk to them about that. The proper way to do this is to
have a secure WiFi network and freely advertise the password. With all this
decoration around the place, they could use framed password art and it would
still be more secure, because at least then the network traffic would be
encoded. Same with the Subway. Sheesh, people! Just because your browser and
most websites these days are using are using SSL security (thank goodness), not
EVERYTHING is secured, like cookie data in the request headers, which just
might carry a hijack-able token. People, don't use open WiFi without
protections. Services like HideMyAss are only like $60/year and have so many
local end-points these days, the slow-down of your surfing and even streaming
is hardly noticeable.

Wow, having color coding turned on in markdown really does make a nice little
difference in the journaling process. Looking at even just a little bit of
color adds some sort of emotional content. I get it. Don't know if I like the
colors, but at least I'm being made aware I need to think about it. Also,
without the wide-format 16x9 HDTV format of desktop monitors where side-by-side
terminals are preferrable because you have plenty of horizontal space to work
with, on a laptop like this I need to choose between 80-columns nearly filling
up my whole screen (zooming-down occasionally for wide-format programming), or
looking at tiny energy-sapping fonts all the time, reproducing the side-by-side
80-column configuration I used when in "static mode" sitting at my desk.

Oh, God, muscle memory is important. And no, I'm not using the Lord's name in
vain here. Muscle memory is one of God's true gifts, and so denied to us in
everyday tech. Okay, so HMA is done installing, and I quite the work-provided
VPN and am trying my own. It connects. Using HMA Fast Mode, because who cares.
This is not for anonymous surfing from anywhere in the world, though I'll talk
plenty about that later. Rather, this is about just a minimum bit of protection
against identity theft on public open networks shouldn't be such a thing,
people COME ON! Okay, Google pushing all websites into end-to-end security
helped, but hijacked cookie tokens and stuff. Use protection.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## Tue Mar 20

Okay, that was interesting. Next? Okay, the big project for today. It's still
about those revenue columns. Wow, that was a bigger project than I expected.
Okay, hit home the going back a whole year thing. But definitely be cognizant
of the fact that you now want to REGULARLY push out Pipulate and PrivateJournal
commits together before you leave at the end of the day. There will ALWAYS be
changes to pipulate now too.

That's all about just sitting and looking at the existing SQL that makes the
join and understanding how I would go about turning that into a filtered
sub-set of that view, applying both:

- The date-range filter (in several places and switching to dual-boundary)
- The chained-up URL where condition that will have (ooo) issues.

Wow, with this new datestamp situation, there's no longer to start a new
journal entry. The whole idea of CUT! is gone. Just gone. And I think I may
like it better this way. It takes off a lot of pressure. This is the test of
whether... yep. The .vimrc change took. Good. It will be nice to have
color-coding in my markdown file in vim now that it doesn't need to have a
.html extension for my old... what was it? Strapdown.js, I think. It was a very
good method for its day to push this out for every-day consumption where I
could use what was it? Hotbox? To watch people read my journal from all over
the world. Ah, those were the days. But alas, no. Now you read this shit
through Github in the miklevin/Pipulate repo, or nowhere. Good luck, haha! I
don't need no stinking voyeuristic JavaScript. There are more important
Noosphere eggs to be frying. Let's get to one.

I actually want to associate this challenging new in-Jupyter Notebook SQL work
that I'm doing with my new laptop. My goal is to be able to go home tonight,
and through both VPN and a repo-less way of transmitting simple sample code for
Jupyter Notebook around, be doing this "revenue column" work. I'm basically
joining tables from all over the place. But what's worse, I'm reaching for some
really valuable data that has all sorts of challenges in reaching... hmmm,
yummy and perfect! Okay, I've got this. No problem.

Problem is, I'm changing floors at work and I generally do my best work... Ah,
switched. I was going to say on a loud keyboard, but I couldn't bring myself to
type it so loudly. When it's quiet here, switch to the laptop.

Wow, always having 2 journals loaded, now with the first named journal.md and
the second named leakyjournal.md is a real kick, let me tell you. How such an
obvious and uber-techie solution to pushing out sanitized private journal
excerpts was so obvious and right under my nose for all this time makes one of
the important points I want to make in this book (the book that this is going
to be source data for) is that light touch solutions are almost always there.

Light touch has got to be one of my catch phrases for all of this Alice in
Wonderland tech analog book I'm making. Wow, things are falling together. Did
you buy the wrong hardware or take up the wrong language years ago, and somehow
feel committed to sticking with it, even though it's draining your soul? Well,
good for you! Dynamic growth is scary, and isn't for everyone. Me? Let me keep
bearing down on this Linux, Python, vim and git track. It's a good one.

But portability of Jupyter Notebook like copy/paste locations that can be
shared between machines... and maybe even...

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## Tue Mar 20

    let @j = '/Bginning of Journal^Mo^M^M^M^M^[kkkk80i-^[j! date^Mi## ^[^Mjzzi'

...becomes:

    let @j = '/Bginning of Journal^Mo^M^M^M^M^[kkkk80i-^[j! date^MwwwD0i##^[^Mjzzi'

It's really that simple. Changed highly detailed timestamps from the Unix
(Linux, of course) "date" command from highly detailed to just:

    Tue Mar 20

...with the addition of:

    wwwD0

...somewhere into a macro, which I keep in a .vimrc file, which I keep in a
repo called vim in a public github repo so that I can pull it down from
anywhere, get the idea?

As an added bonus, if I leave my cursor at the top of the pipulate version of
the journal, when I switch to it with a :bn (for buffer, next in vim-speak) I
know just hitting the p for paste and then saving it, and then going back to
the top of the document and hitting :bn again sort of "stages it" both to be
published on the next inevitable commit and push of changes to the Pipulate
project from this machine, but it's also staged for the very easy publishing of
my next bit of stuff. No fancy system-building. Just one file in
/usr/local/sbin so that every time I open a new terminal, I can just type:

    j[Enter]

...and have both journals loaded for easy permission-controlled publishing, yet
all from just vim and git. No graphical OS really even required here. This is
less than wristwatch-level power you're requiring here to host your
journal/publishing system... for life. Just add Internet connection and common
free stuff.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## Tue Mar 20 11:06:48 DST 2018

Okay, I have a lot to do today, but first it's time to eliminate accurate
timestamps in my private journal macro. It's been attempted to be used against
me even one little bit, so it's gone. But none of the actual benefits of the
journal itself will be gone. Nope, rather my loud and very distinct inner voice
is going to not be talked-over, and it's going to go, yup. Solution provided. I
control the timestamps. I control the reality. Timestamps are only as accurate
as the day's date. Morning, night, who knows? There's some sense of linear
sequence, but I think out loud a lot on my lunchbreak and on the subway now
with my Surface Book 2 laptop, where I can work anywhere quite well to be
always-there, always-on and at my own expense for the best laptop in the world
right now available-- although middle-of-the-line, because I'm not made of
money. I just like my tools. And I think I need to assert myself from time to
time to keep this situation and the opportunities here viable, and me free off
all the signs of burn-out that have already set-in after just 2 years. Nope.
Fix or leave. Fixing begun. Timestamps...

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## Tue Mar 20

Beginning of... oops can't type that or I'll mess up my Macro. Time to get
a'crackin'. My mission today is this SQL Query thing to go back a year ago in
revenue numbers... wow! I should of done that yesterday... or maybe even
Friday, but wow. The office move, the new laptop freeing me to work anywhere,
and all the settling in, which is... oh, let me tell you about it! But wow, can
I do some cool samurai data moves on that thing now. I need a more full-time
built-in WiFi, and I was hoping for... wait! I'm going to publish this. I know
that. This is a critical part of the Datamaster journal-- calibrating one's
tools for maximum effectiveness under all the conditions you're likely to find
yourself in. For too long, I've used old Mabook Airs... 3 of them, to be
precise, haha! I have 2 now still myself. Gotta set Adi up on one, but they're
so old-school: no touch-screens and high-res artist's stylus. What's that you
say? Neither do modern Macs? You've got to be kidding, that's got to be a
joke... what? At least their Phablet has a Stylus so that Differently Thinking
Artists can... what? No stylus, either? What happened? Does Apple still
exist... oh, a consumer goods company yous say? Maximum profitability, sheep,
Jobs is dead and all that? Okay, got it. Still wearing my Apple Watch and
making the SE my wallet-phone. The NYC 212-NYB-1337 number is getting ported to
the Note 8, because I needed a phone-number as cool as everything else in my
life, now that my transplanted roots are really beginning to set in... here...
in New York City, where I live with the best view of it right on the edge of
Staten Island. I've finally gone UrbyLife.

Okay, I still have a little publishing resistance because there are some
annoying kung fu keyboard moves of loading another file on a different path
into the second vim buffer. I can totally do it, but I'm fatigued just thinking
about what that would take.

    The light! The light!
    The lite, the lite, the lite.
    So, fight! So, fight!
    And fight and fight and fight.

Even on this floor, there will be big-time mental distractions. The sound of
your inside voice has to be as loud as the chatter, or else people won't
realize their chatter is a part of your background noise while you're trying to
work. That's okay. That's the cubicle deal. People type, and I'm using a very
high quality keyboard, thank you very much. And I shouldn't HAVE TO try to
drown it out with headphones blasting music into my head, and I'll damn-well
talk about it as a focus and survival strategy for creatives in the cubicles of
modern business, readily. It's a fine topic to discuss, especially at the very
moment it's an issue, and you need something as your ohhhhm to regain center,
and get back to some important work.

Okay, there.

Now where were we?

Oh yes, make it so that publishing this will be nice and easy from here on out.
And that means either a something.sh in your current directory (which you'll
never be quite sure you're in) or putting it somewhere in your path, and
chmod'ing it to have +x permissions (execution). So, this is your second step,
because it is true, everything is a LITTLE BIT difficult. They used to joke
about Unix that that was intentional to make an elite class of techs, and well
yeah, sorta. It's called smart enough to appreciate inside jokes, and it's
important in the Unix world, which WAS a priesthood even though its progenitors
were badboys, because of the great commercial and proprietary potential of Unix
to vendors like AT&T... and Novell... and SCO. Oops, proprietary was something
special, was it? Not when it's the commodities, and basically free because it's
only already-ripped-off data, because it's digital data. Blackbox copying has
inconsequential cost, which is what Linux and RMS did. So...

So, bash shortcuts in sbin. Sbin is a funny thing. It's supposed to be these
tiny little one-off script files that you plan to use a lot, and they're still
usually script or bash or shell files. They're all sort of the same since bash,
the "Bourne-again shell", became so durn popular. It's got to be more than just
the basic vanilla Unix "shell" with no command-line history or completion, so
everyone at least uses the first mega-popular one that nothing else ever quite
displaced. So, the language flavor of Unix scripting you should be using is
bash, and they usually just have a .sh extension for shell.

Okay, getting there might take a little while but the payoff is enormous. This
entire seeing the sausage factory process of permanently improving my
day-to-day workflow is being exposed here in the Pipulate repo for everyone to
see... haha! But the world is different forever once achieved. Everything
hinges on moments like these, such as the next time I want to publish like this
won't be anywhere near as difficult.

Keep my go/zd gnu screen session going that shows my every 10-minute heartbeat
after the daily regimine of scripts stops running... or really is just paused
waiting for later in the day when the speed-checks begin, so it gets a fair
assessment of the speeds of different sites (can't run that during the night).
But that report will probably be changing now that Google has an site speed
check now for almost precisely the same scorecard type thing. So much I can gut
and take a sawzaw to, and build newer better stuff to replace it... easily and
more easily than maintaining the old stuff, and that's like one of the big
points about having an employee like my. My stuff is only built to last for
about a year until realities change. Lean into that. Allow scrap and rebuild to
occur, but don't keep me playing little dutch boy and the dike. If a dam's
going to bust if left unchecked and I've said so a lot, then I'm just going to
let it bust. I'm not paid enough to keep old dams from busting AND building new
ones. That's a losing proposition, so I've got a plan.

That plan is sbin.

Gotta always remind yourself of the location.

It's an odd incantation, but this is it:

    echo $PATH

9 times out of 10, it's going to be /usr/local/sbin and it's going to be the
first thing in your path. Understand that, and you're going to understand a lot
about Unix and Linux. The next step, I'm going to tell you to do in vim as your
frustrating and fateful first encounter with the big green monster. Wanna be a
badass tech always packing sharp quarrels in your quiver that'll really make
'em shiver when they see the kind of tech who is really good as heck. Oh, I
don't even need a .sh extension.

    sudo vim /usr/local/sbin/j
    :i
    vim /home/journal/index.html /mnt/c/Users/whome/github/pipulate/theleakyjournal.md
    [Esc]:wq
    sudo chmod +x /usr/local/sbin/j

Left out some details like how you should hit enter. Wave. Quit... tested! Wow!
Now, go publish this shit.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## Fri Mar
### Getting down the rhythm of the Pipulate workflow

You lost the flow. Time to re-establish. These things are taking you wayyyy
longer than they should. I've got idea... I'm going to change my vim macro to
only give the day in the timestamp... hahaha! Only the day is important to
anyone who lacks the ability to see when the git commits occurred-- hahaha!
Wow, I've become a tech asshole. You people have to watch me. I really don't
want to become what I hate, those Green Arrows can eat my Blue Beetles. But not
until after the work-and-hand is done. So far, we have...

- Templates are for purple cows
- Whipping docs get nuked for morbid
- Copy from a Pipulating GSheets (create consistent compelling language here)
- Copy from the Purple Cow farm.

Now, you've got Whipping Doc with no more tabs than what you absolutely need...
not quite true. One blank sheet may still be in there, which you can delete
because you don't need anymore.

Good language developing: "Oh yeah, that's a pipulating sheet. Don't reorganize
those columns (or do) because that's pipulating live. It's a pipulating live
pipulating sheet. Don't pipulate with me, I'll pipulate your pipulate.
Recursion limit reached."

Okay, recover state...

- NOW ADD NEW TEMPLATE COLUMNS INTO LOCATION

Ah, Newspace! A purple cow in the cow farm need not a column or row more than
it need. It should indeed be pruned so you can click the copy-whole-spreadsheet
magical place in all spreadsheet software. That is VERY GOOD. This is the sort
of non-system system invention that Pipulate should be built from. Just know if
you do these such-and-such obvious-in-hindsight things (trimming unnecessary
rows and columns) everything will go more smoothly in your Pipulate workflow...
something that is very worth getting worked-out just-so because of the
effortless mastery things like fixed-position brings to them over time. Every
fixed position where you can re-acquire home and recalibrate and regain state
real quick is a treasure.

Newsflash: Conditional formatting doesn't copy-paste even with "Paste special"
between sheets. Consequently, there's definitely got to be a lot of
right-clicking on tabs to "copy them into" other sheets. That seems to preserve
it, but there's none of the required formatting in my Purple Cow Farm template
tab, which I realized late in that project. And I fixed it in the Whipping Doc,
but I have to copy it back from the Whipping Doc to the Purple Cow Farm... wow,
this is going to work.

Okay, confirmed. Copying sheets through GSheet's "Copy to" on the Tab's menu
preserves the conditional formatting... pshwew! Purple cows can stay purple.
Oh, always color-code a the tabs in The Purple Cow farm purple... color coding
is going to be some powerful stuff in this non-system system.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## Fri Mar

Okay, when doing new work, the work-rhythm looks like this:

Make sure the Purple Cow Farm has your template checked-in (so to speak).

Nuke your whipping-doc for morbid. Know 2 things are about to be zapped into
there. You are merging 2 source-documents:

- Your live-deployed GSheet that's back-ended by "scheduled" pipulate.
- Your template from the purple cow
- Copy-to Recent from the "Tab" menu in GSheets is going to be a common thing.
- Once a tab is copied that way, it gets renamed to "Copy of [Old sheet name]"

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## Fri Mar 16
### Blank The Whipping Doc for Morbid. It's the only way to be sure.

Okay, now down to business... again. And this time for real. This is very
serious business. But my distractions were in forming a very focused mental
model for this type of work today and FOREVER FORWARD MORE IMPORTANT THAN IT
LOOKED distraction. Tired of leaping for peanuts.

Speaking of speaking my mind. I know it's probably politically incorrect, but a
WORK-IN-PROGRESS document is a whipping doc. It's got a very powerful concept
there. You can blank the whipping doc. It is wise to blank the whipping doc, in
fact because if you have a Purple Cow Farm with your format in it, All other
instances than what's live in-scheduling will just muddle don't force a rhyme.
vim out!

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## Fri Mar 16
### If I Saw a Purple Cow, I'd Pick Out a Good Nickname

Time is an illusion. Okay, Purple Cow Farm in-hand, we have a solid "from"
place, once our template-work (sculpting light) is done in whatever, wherever
format woo hoo everything-independent where we can be. We copy all that
artistic header-area stuff of the WORK-IN-PROGRESS document (anything, anywhere
like Excel or another GSheet) into the Purple Cow document. You ALWAYS include
the first data-row, which is the row usually immediately below your frozen
title rows. There's some ambiguity around what we call this area, but I'll use
header for consistency with typical office-speak. So, we put the complete
header and first data-row into its own tab in The Purple Cow Farm. Things line
Red/Green color-coding rules get carried in that first data-row, so it's really
important. I wouldn't try blanking the data in there, or you're in for all
sorts of accidental formatting-loss issues. Just assume all the data in Purple
Cow is for-position-only (FPO). Okay... now we have a destination document.
It's where we "blend into" and should be the SAME as your work-progress
document, so you don't have to be giving out new Google Sheet URLs all the
time. Even the SEO in me screams out no to that concept. WIP (work-in-progress)
documents should get good strong nicknames and have a long life as such a
kooky-nicknamed thing... until you rename it for a demo to a stakeholder who
doesn't need to see it by that name. But then, it's almost an inside joke that
it's really the such-and-such document, because you've touched them on an
emotional level with a just-so-perfect nickname...

And that my friends is SEO. Walk the walk so you can talk the talk... be DEEPLY
engaged in the game by partaking in all the plentiful Noosphere being created
by every move Google makes... every step it takes, we'll be... oh wait, it's
watching us... nevermind.

### Just Invented Purple Cow Farms for Templates

I just hit on a very, very powerful method. Why just use one journal in vim
when you could be using two! One of them in a private git repo and the other in
a public Github repo, but with no special effort taken to format or publish it,
besides naming the file with a .md extension and putting it in the parent
directory of a repo I think I'll be driving a lot of eyes to and think I'll be
able to turn this into a good lesson in iron bars to not a prison make nor
cubicles a circus. Minds both intent and focused can still squeak out a
workplace. As non-technical people suspect and sometimes fear, the shell-game
in doing very advanced-seeming stuff in tech requires a lot less actual work
than what it appears. But that cover of being busy and stressed-out and always
intently working on something is very important. Mechanical keyboards that you
can feel click under your fingers is important too. Get into the zone whatever
way you can, and if that means throwing up a shield of better not interrupt,
then so be it. 1, 2, 3... 1? Templates are PURPLE! MAKE YOUR PURPLE TEMPLATE
DOCUMENT. A purple cow farm. HAHAHA! You sometimes look for the proper amount
of ridculoustemity in your nicknames. Ohhh, push this out.

1, 2, 3... 1: Go find your Purple Cow.

    Different rhymes for different times
    And if you don't renew 'em
    From time to time, you'll fail to climb
    And fall down in a ruin.

    Purple is for templates now;
    The other colors taken.
    Make them be your Purple Cow
    To never be forsaken!

    I've only got one document
    That's named The Purple Cow Farm;
    Templates-tabs-- from there are sent
    With minimum of brain-harm.

    The Purple Cow will teleport
    The columns where they function
    While you try to stop a fork
    Off version we be junkin'

Make donuts. 1, 2, 3... 1? Source Templates! It's all about reflecting the
right light with the proper incantations. Everything will shine through your
Google Docs templates, which you really should set up ahead of time, because
although you CAN apply some formatting with PyGal which apparently doesn't use
GData but something else more formal under the Developer Console (GData is so
old it predates API-unification under-console). I need to get this stuff out,
because it's important about Pipulate. Getting started on a project in the
morning where ambitions are high because they realize the: if Data Samurai,
then following views we've never before been able to consistently:

- produce
- make readily/easily available
- yet still secure the data

...that one would thing should easily be possible. It's not. But I'm here to
solve that. You're gonna have to drink some Koolaid, so ya had better get used
to it. What, you think Google is going away? What, you think the search game is
going to be disrupted because of some AI-startup? Forget it. A 10x early-mover
advantage in this game is exponentially more than you think. Thinks are
learning and those learnings are persisting and trickling out all over have its
input improved from all over the place... not human by a long-shot, but a damn
bigger chasm that newcomers need to cross than you can imagine.

So, why even try.

Different game, lads. I'm in a different game, with what I hope is another 20
years of exploi... ahem, exploration left to do.

Forget the #xbook tag. Just publish in the Pipulate repo. This is what you were
born to do. vim out.

I'm just kidding. I won't leak. But I'll probably sanitize as I type so that
when I copy/paste daily journal entries over here, I won't have to do much
editing. Consider this a history with the most recent thoughts posted as an
entry at the top. Let's make up a word for this... oh, it's on the web, and
it's a log. I know! Let's call it a blog. And here's my first copy/pasta...

1, 2, 3... 1? List.

You will have various 1, 2, 3... 1? List's in your life.
https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets is one

This is because Google Sheets is 80/20-rule good enough. And I will go into
that a lot more soon. In the meanwhile, I'm thinking to myself how this gets
published and pushed out in a reasonable way, and I'm thinking to myself, the
Pipulate repo, dumbass! There's going to be some eyes on that thing, and this
maybe forever forward in the quite interesting by now never-rebased but
definitely should have been but keeping it that way for more badassitute oughta
watch my mouth paid my dues on Jupyter Notebook now and appreciate what I've
got because... Flask version of Pipulate... OMG! I needed nested bubbling
yields used generically through Pipulate-compatible functions if you wanted
that twinkling UI-feedback that could be sent on the same response that was to
the original page-request, just don't stop building the page and use that no
ajax webserver tech required cause it all uses the highly compatible magical
capabilities of modern browsers to pull it off no JavaScript libraries required
genuingenuity. BAM. Should'a started that project on Python 3 where yields
actually could nest and bubble. Oh, but the complexity, and the trap had it
really worked well... would not be on Jupyter Notebook today really
appreciating it for the miracle the iPython and Continuum.io people really
pulled off there.

Okay, that was my "I am a true Samurai-repurposer of tech once I've aquired it
old'skool real. Oh there I go again with hyperbole. See! I can't even just say
hype. Well, that's me. Welcome to full-on corny nerd. And it's going in right
here, because performance art. Bust-out-ittude and other crazy made-up SEO
words because that's it. I'm an SEO. I'm here to walk the walk while I talk
the talk, and if you're not out here doing something interesting on Github,
then you're not out here. STOP! Reports checked. Now, bake donuts. Recover this
state. It is important. vim out!

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## Fri Mar 16

It's time to bake the donuts.

No, first check the reports!

And get into the mindset of santizing this again as you write, timestamps
removed of course in a time-displaced published version... who knows when this
occurred unless you're reading over my shoulder. Oh, permissions and
securities, and the philosophy behind your thoughts truly being V for Vendetta
versus eventually enough on the Cloud... well, whatever.

For now, we check reports then bake donuts... then stop and survey the
landscape.

- What's most broken?
- Which work gives us the most bang for the buck?
- What plates need spinning (think about 3rd or else there goes your day)

Might as well be on the best. I want to be on the best hardware of my life
while I'm doing the best work of my life.
