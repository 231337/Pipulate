### Blank The Whipping Doc for Morbid. It's the only way to be sure.

Okay, now down to business... again. And this time for real. This is very
serious business. But my distractions were in forming a very focused mental
model for this type of work today and FOREVER FORWARD MORE IMPORTANT THAN IT
LOOKED distraction. Tired of leaping for peanuts.

Speaking of speaking my mind. I know it's probably politically incorrect, but a
WORK-IN-PROGRESS document is a whipping doc. It's got a very powerful concept
there. You can blank the whipping doc. It is wise to blank the whipping doc, in
fact because if you have a Purple Cow Farm with your format in it, All other
instances than what's life will just muddle don't force a rhyme. vim out!

### If I Saw a Purple Cow, I'd Pick Out a Good Nickname

Time is an illusion. Okay, Purple Cow Farm in-hand, we have a solid "from"
place, once our template-work (sculpting light) is done in whatever, wherever
format woo hoo everything-independent where we can be. We copy all that
artistic header-area stuff of the WORK-IN-PROGRESS document (anything, anywhere
like Excel or another GSheet) into the Purple Cow document. You ALWAYS include
the first data-row, which is the row usually immediately below your frozen
title rows. There's some ambiguity around what we call this area, but I'll use
header for consistency with typical office-speak. So, we put the complete
header and first data-row into its own tab in The Purple Cow Farm. Things line
Red/Green color-coding rules get carried in that first data-row, so it's really
important. I wouldn't try blanking the data in there, or you're in for all
sorts of accidental formatting-loss issues. Just assume all the data in Purple
Cow is for-position-only (FPO). Okay... now we have a destination document.
It's where we "blend into" and should be the SAME as your work-progress
document, so you don't have to be giving out new Google Sheet URLs all the
time. Even the SEO in me screams out no to that concept. WIP (work-in-progress)
documents should get good strong nicknames and have a long life as such a
kooky-nicknamed thing... until you rename it for a demo to a stakeholder who
doesn't need to see it by that name. But then, it's almost an inside joke that
it's really the such-and-such document, because you've touched them on an
emotional level with a just-so-perfect nickname...

And that my friends is SEO. Walk the walk so you can talk the talk... be DEEPLY
engaged in the game by partaking in all the plentiful Noosphere being created
by every move Google makes... every step it takes, we'll be... oh wait, it's
watching us... nevermind.

### Just Invented Purple Cow Farms for Templates

I just hit on a very, very powerful method. Why just use one journal in vim
when you could be using two! One of them in a private git repo and the other in
a public Github repo, but with no special effort taken to format or publish it,
besides naming the file with a .md extension and putting it in the parent
directory of a repo I think I'll be driving a lot of eyes to and think I'll be
able to turn this into a good lesson in iron bars to not a prison make nor
cubicles a circus. Minds both intent and focused can still squeak out a
workplace. As non-technical people suspect and sometimes fear, the shell-game
in doing very advanced-seeming stuff in tech requires a lot less actual work
than what it appears. But that cover of being busy and stressed-out and always
intently working on something is very important. Mechanical keyboards that you
can feel click under your fingers is important too. Get into the zone whatever
way you can, and if that means throwing up a shield of better not interrupt,
then so be it. 1, 2, 3... 1? Templates are PURPLE! MAKE YOUR PURPLE TEMPLATE
DOCUMENT. A purple cow farm. HAHAHA! You sometimes look for the proper amount
of ridculoustemity in your nicknames. Ohhh, push this out.

1, 2, 3... 1: Go find your Purple Cow.

    Different rhymes for different times
    And if you don't renew 'em
    From time to time, you'll fail to climb
    And fall down in a ruin.

    Purple is for templates now;
    The other colors taken.
    Make them be your Purple Cow
    To never be forsaken!

    I've only got one document
    That's named The Purple Cow Farm;
    Templates-tabs-- from there are sent
    With minimum of brain-harm.

    The Purple Cow will teleport
    The columns where they function
    While you try to stop a fork
    Off version we be junkin'

Make donuts. 1, 2, 3... 1? Source Templates! It's all about reflecting the
right light with the proper incantations. Everything will shine through your
Google Docs templates, which you really should set up ahead of time, because
although you CAN apply some formatting with PyGal which apparently doesn't use
GData but something else more formal under the Developer Console (GData is so
old it predates API-unification under-console). I need to get this stuff out,
because it's important about Pipulate. Getting started on a project in the
morning where ambitions are high because they realize the: if Data Samurai,
then following views we've never before been able to consistently:

- produce
- make readily/easily available
- yet still secure the data

...that one would thing should easily be possible. It's not. But I'm here to
solve that. You're gonna have to drink some Koolaid, so ya had better get used
to it. What, you think Google is going away? What, you think the search game is
going to be disrupted because of some AI-startup? Forget it. A 10x early-mover
advantage in this game is exponentially more than you think. Thinks are
learning and those learnings are persisting and trickling out all over have its
input improved from all over the place... not human by a long-shot, but a damn
bigger chasm that newcomers need to cross than you can imagine.

So, why even try.

Different game, lads. I'm in a different game, with what I hope is another 20
years of exploi... ahem, exploration left to do.

Forget the #xbook tag. Just publish in the Pipulate repo. This is what you were
born to do. vim out.

I'm just kidding. I won't leak. But I'll probably sanitize as I type so that
when I copy/paste daily journal entries over here, I won't have to do much
editing. Consider this a history with the most recent thoughts posted as an
entry at the top. Let's make up a word for this... oh, it's on the web, and
it's a log. I know! Let's call it a blog. And here's my first copy/pasta...

1, 2, 3... 1? List.

You will have various 1, 2, 3... 1? List's in your life.
https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets is one

This is because Google Sheets is 80/20-rule good enough. And I will go into
that a lot more soon. In the meanwhile, I'm thinking to myself how this gets
published and pushed out in a reasonable way, and I'm thinking to myself, the
Pipulate repo, dumbass! There's going to be some eyes on that thing, and this
maybe forever forward in the quite interesting by now never-rebased but
definitely should have been but keeping it that way for more badassitute oughta
watch my mouth paid my dues on Jupyter Notebook now and appreciate what I've
got because... Flask version of Pipulate... OMG! I needed nested bubbling
yields used generically through Pipulate-compatible functions if you wanted
that twinkling UI-feedback that could be sent on the same response that was to
the original page-request, just don't stop building the page and use that no
ajax webserver tech required cause it all uses the highly compatible magical
capabilities of modern browsers to pull it off no JavaScript libraries required
genuingenuity. BAM. Should'a started that project on Python 3 where yields
actually could nest and bubble. Oh, but the complexity, and the trap had it
really worked well... would not be on Jupyter Notebook today really
appreciating it for the miracle the iPython and Continuum.io people really
pulled off there.

Okay, that was my "I am a true Samurai-repurposer of tech once I've aquired it
old'skool real. Oh there I go again with hyperbole. See! I can't even just say
hype. Well, that's me. Welcome to full-on corny nerd. And it's going in right
here, because performance art. Bust-out-ittude and other crazy made-up SEO
words because that's it. I'm an SEO. I'm here to walk the walk while I talk
the talk, and if you're not out here doing something interesting on Github,
then you're not out here. STOP! Reports checked. Now, bake donuts. Recover this
state. It is important. vim out!

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## Fri Mar 16 

It's time to bake the donuts.

No, first check the reports!

And get into the mindset of santizing this again as you write, timestamps
removed of course in a time-displaced published version... who knows when this
occurred unless you're reading over my shoulder. Oh, permissions and
securities, and the philosophy behind your thoughts truly being V for Vendetta
versus eventually enough on the Cloud... well, whatever.

For now, we check reports then bake donuts... then stop and survey the
landscape.

- What's most broken?
- Which work gives us the most bang for the buck?
- What plates need spinning (think about 3rd or else there goes your day)

Might as well be on the best. I want to be on the best hardware of my life
while I'm doing the best work of my life.
