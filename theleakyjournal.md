### Creation of Pipulation

Welcome ladies and gentlemen to the birth of the wizarding world. All around
you today you will find clues that everything imaginable to humans in on the
verge of coming into being, either virtual or real. Fairylands and wild flights
of fancy are all on the menu, so long as they are economically viable. Virtual
worlds such as World of Warcraft, Second Life and everything that's replaced
them in the modern age showed us that. Books like Verner Vinge's Rainbows End
and Neal Stephenson's Snowcrash and everything that's replaced them in the
modern age have shown us vivid visions of vivid visions. 

The new breed of computer interaction that is upon is is like the next step of
what happened with Star Trek communicators, which we have long-since
leapfrogged. Next-up is all the voice recognition and augmented realities.
When you're casting a spell with a vocal incantation, it will be your own
personal A.I.  agent listening to and responding to you. When you draw gestures
and symbols in the air, it will be that same intelligent agent watching your
augmented reality scribblings. 3D printed robots will provide your flying
drone-fairies and gated-utopia oasis built in whatever otherwise barren harsh
bleak landscapes, such as Kansas farmland, will be your Oz.

There is a certain amount of time between now and then when it won't be nearly
so easy from a natural human spoken-language perspective, or Minority Report
style air-swoosh gestures to bring sophisticated machine automation control to
the average person, education-wise as we know ourselves today to be. It's going
to take several Herculean baby-steps forward to get ourselves as a general
population to where most of us are as comfortable controlling and instructing
machines as we are bossing each other around. Most of the world in other words
is going to have an AI-dependency. They are going to be AI-dependent.

This will apply to everything from driving to typing to tying your own
shoelaces. Handwriting? Who needs it! And in many ways, this thinking is
correct. Progress and the gradual shifting and drifting of social norms
generation to generation could turn common-sense backwards in only about 4 or 5
generations, which is just long enough for everyone alive to no longer have any
living memory of the consequences of the mistakes of the past. Horror which was
once an up-close and personal thing becomes a distant, abstract, and no-longer
an automatic human-decency dissuasion against committing atrocity. The world
forgets to become outraged against genocides and such. That is our present
state, which as Jared Diamond points out (I believe because I have never really
read it) in his book Collapse. We're perched for a plunge.

The rest of this writing today deals with how to keep you from being sheep
according to a new methodology I am developing right here and now today. Things
like it may have existed before, but this particular implementation is mine.
It's called Pipulate and many of you have seen iterations of it in the past.
The coolest one was a Flash microwebserver that streamed a single page back at
you that carried it's entire ongoing I/O throughout the "pipulation" process.
It was awesome, but alas a dead-end because of GUI-issues. 

Mikey no likey front-end work. It's like hand-coding PostScript. No wonder it's
called JavaScript-- it's exactly in the tradition of a language nobody was
every intended to hand-code. It's no wonder all these CSS parsing tools exist
and all these sub-language framework .js libraries pop up like fleas. The
LISP-club is back in the form of The Full Webstack (du jour) movement, and it's
all a bit to arcane and scrap-and-rebuild competitive millennials there for me.
I've seen it and been there and done that a few too many times to let my
precious mapping-space in my brain for muscle-memories that must last for a
lifetime (or at least a career) to get muddled up with beauty contests and
horse races and the latest hardware platform nuanced details.

For those who don't understand what I mean by hardware details, it's all about
the user interface. Take touch-screens for example. Precisely how do they work
code-wise. What about multi-touch? Can you assume pinch-and-zoom? What is the
operating system supposed to do here versus what you're supposed to do
"manually" with your programming code? JavaScript has a lot of this, because
it's event-driven by design. While this may make it ideal for user-interface
design, this is precisely the part of coding that I really despise. I like the
"back end" or invisibly running part of coding. Insert random joke here.

Despite what labels you slap onto these two different types of coding, the
differences are as profound as introvert vs. extrovert... or whether WWF still
means World Wrestling Federation to you. The hardware/software combo that
constitutes the "complete" platform often have rabid fans... rabid fans who
remember their particular hardware that was popular as they were becoming aware
human beings from about age 6 to 16 as the good old days. This is the beginning
of your rosy reminiscence. Monday, Tuesday, Happy Days... groovin' bout tech
with you!

From around 18 to 25 you discover life is awesome but short. If you make it to
28 then in your 30s, hopefully you figure out who you are, what you're about,
and precisely what motivates you and where you "draw energy from" in life--
usually after having given it a few failed attempts. I'm in my late 40s now,
and I'm kinda sorta seeing that if you've made it this far, gone through a
life-altering adjustment or two to keep yourself sane, stabilized things enough
to STILL be thinking about the future, then you're in a position to do a bit of
that Steve Jobs-style Universe-pinging if you've still got it in you. 

The only thing that's different now is that suddenly, with that wee tiny bit of
extra capacity you have due to the nature of having done almost everything
"like that" 2 or 3 times before, when you're faced with new challenges, you can
create 2nd or 3rd generation solutions even just while the rest of the folks
are cluing in on the fact that there clearly should be such a thing in the
modern age as a Data Master. When they realize it and turn to see what a
datamaster should be, here they shall find this journal in the Pipulate
repository, and the seminal articles of the rise of datamastering will be
"discovered" by googling googlers... for you see, I am an SEO.

Today I've decided to life-hack myself into a compulsively addicted to data
datamaster. This is a bootstrapping trick. Once you do this to yourself, you
are deeply accountable to yourself and not off the hook... ever... until you
turn off your automations, disaster strikes, you stop paying your cloud bill,
or your dying days. Really, a properly put-in-place filename.service started
with systemctl enable should run for as long as the system its running on is
still there running. And whatever that thing is that's running will be under
your explicit control, right down to how often the operating system checks to
make sure it's still running. The OS has the responsibility to re-spawn it if
it's not running. Everything is else is up to you in whatever that thing is
that it's running.

And that thing it's running is a Python script that's actually intended to be
able to be running 24x7, but would actually be folly to do so because the world
is not a perfect place, and all machines need a little rest in the form of a
reboot. Nuke the place from orbit, it's the only way to be sure. Wow, I used to
think that quote was Nuke the place for morbid... ugh. Anyhoo, our first step
in our scheduled script is to set a nightly reboot. But I am actually against
the clock once again. I'm not publishing and pushing out these articles nearly
as much as I should. I'm doing my Universe-dinging here and nobody will know it
unless you announce it and push out and forward the narrative.

Okay, I am inspired by Intel's tick-tock model. They had some time-unit in mind
in which they SHOULD be able to produce such-and-such sort of advancements not
beyond their reach according to all their experience, and then hold themselves
accountable to that schedule. Additionally, the cycles of tick and tock
actually mean different things. Tick is a more aggressive and foundational
advancement while a tock cycle is a refinement and optimization cycle. Between
an aggressively culture-itized tick+tock rhythm a company like Intel, which
arguably didn't start out with the best IC-design templates in the world
none-the-less self-improved and self-re-invented such that even if it has to
turn a massive ship to compete with billions little ARM gnats, it can. And
that's an amazing thing.

So, my version of tick-tock, designed to hold MYSELF accountable to a likewise
aggressive, yet sanely sized baby-step advancement routine starts with creating
the routine. The routine is my new Pipulate generalized reporting system for
SEO and a plethora of other uses you will I expect find to put it to.

Everything begins with a login session to some remote machine running
somewhere. In my case, it's a company-provided Amazon EC2 instance. I'm pretty
sure I'm a "home" directory on some larger shared by the occasional
server-needing co-worker. I know this because when I log into that machine and
cd ~/ and then cd .. (one dir up) and ls (list files & folders), I see a bunch
of my co-workers names. I'm named ubuntu. I was the first default user when my
DevOps guy set up this environment (I think). Woot! 

As it turns out, I have my little helper commands that also serve as a sort of
documentation of my own work (reading the contents of your alias shortcuts)
spread between 2 directories: ~/ (aka home) and /usr/local/sbin. This is
interesting because I thought I was on my own dedicated virtual machine, but it
makes sense for them to put multiple users on the same machine. Just keep it in
mind, because naturally now we're timeshare-nested at least 2 degrees deep.
That EC2 server is partitioned out of the Amazon datacenter, and then within
that particular hardware of the EC2 instance (yes, there's real hardware there)
is further shared between whatever users you load on that system, because the
thing the EC2 instance is emulating is a Linux server, which itself is
multi-user. And the number of machines DevOps has to maintain goes down as
user-per-machine goes up. Don't let it bother you. Just keep it in mind. DevOps
folks who let you play with VMs on their budget because they trust you are at
the top of the cool-people column.

Okay, my special keyboard commands right now are:

sd: show all MY running services. It grep's on the word that is common to both
my scheduler.service files. I sd a lot to see if it's just the one (always)
running service or both. If both, I'm in the rapid-creation mode that I need to
create for myself right now, this instance. It's the fire under my ass that I
need. The other command is:

z2s: This STARTS the service that runs on a very rapid basis. Lock yourself
into that cycle and go. Pipulate the hell out of the rest of the time that you
have. You still may not be able to do it, but it really is just still 11:30 AM
and you started at 9:30 AM and you already whipped yourself up into this
frenzied let's make progress mode! Feel GOOD ABOUT YOUR YOURSELF and your
capabilities! Who else can do this? Who else can take this next step and lock
themselves into this new in the noosphere extreme coding technique and very
particular recipe I'm describing. Crackling energies. Lightning about to be
drawn down from the sky.

The things to remember are these:

1. You will have TWO scripts running under systemd from the outset.
2. The OS makes sure each of these scripts is running every 5 seconds.
3. These scripts are scheduler.py and scheduler2.py, respectively.
   - While these names are arbitrary, the repetition helps sbin commands.
4. If the Python scripts are continuously running, the OS does not interfere.
5. By convention, our python scripts use the PyPI schedule library.
6. By convention, we schedule a nightly exit of our Python script.
   - This ensures that we're working with a clean slate every 24-hours.
7. The scheduler2.py is set to be "aggressive" in its schedule-cycle
   - A report is set to update every 30-seconds to 2-minutes.
   - I'm choosing every 1-minute for today's exercise
   - I'm also making the log-file heartbeat be every 15-seconds
   - That's 4 beats to a bar. Good for muscle memory but not quite Johnny Cash.

This is about to be a magical 3 hours-- the complete germination of a new
system. First order of business: making sure you can optionally turn-off the
hitting of the "expensive" (i.e. non-Google) APIs... Okay, edited out the
actual hitting of the API. You must thing of the rest of my writing from this
point on over the next 3 hours just commentary. It is fast-and-furious, because
it is the birth of a new system, and I am working as much on intuition here as
reason, and it ain't no damn tutorial. If this works out, light will show the
way. Anyhoo, 1, 2, 3... 1! No question here. Edit the file scheduler2.py is
invoking every minute. No lack of clarity here. Deep breath. This is the last
moment of the pre-pipulate era. I'm about to do the first real session of what
I hereby coin pipulating. Now, make a light show!

First, we ALWAYS pipulate generally the same way from an initial template. All
we know is that this thing will be run, run and run again every minute, so make
every line of code you put down do its role, and do it immediately. And you
better sure as hell be sure you're taking baby-steps or you're about to have a
systemd respawning loop-the sign of pipulating being out of whack and an
adjustment to the process required. It's just a little Python code sitting in
any old filename.py file that you know Linux is going to keep running if you
don't. Don't let Linux have the chance!

Create the first-row system. If A1 contains the world map, then it's a field
mapping row that should be hidden. Right? This should be row 1 because then you
are always sure to have it above the first frozen row, which must by necessity
be 2. Do it.

Totally in the zone, and this is actually pretty amazing. I can actually "feel"
the fast iteration high feedback ad hoc and scheduled reports being the same
thing system coming into creation. I'll have to expose the git history at some
point. The key insight here is that because you're in a scheduler and you can
therefore pump up the schedule to every minute and get a real-time feedback
loop going on designing the report. This is just so critical on being what you
need to be at this company. After the report's designed, you cut down the
cycle.

Okay, this is the Oh Shit critical moment. I have a dataframe loading from the
sheet. I need to make it look just like a mock-up now. I'm making fabulous
progress. Code is being kept minimal, readable and the function self-evident at
a glance. Very nice. Now I've got to populate a data grid as a test.

And everything went well and the phone-call even went well. And then there was
the follow-up with the stakeholder.

Pshwew! Much of the rest of today went into creating the quick jumping-around
muscle memory /usr/local/sbin shortcuts. I basically applied much of what I was
doing on my local laptop (Carroll) to the remote EC2 cloud server. I also took
a lot of the shortcuts that resided IN THE REPO and thus created ambiguity
about when they worked and when they didn't based on what directory I was cd'd
into, and moved them all to sbin.

I additionally renamed what I've been referring to as scheduler.service and
scheduler2.service into pipulate.service and pipulate2.service, respectively.
That way, the following keyboard shortcuts in sbin do the following:

- p: Lists all running gnu screen sessions with pipulate in the name
- p2: Toggles on or off the pipulate2.service (pipulate.service always runs)
- z: Enters the gnu screen session named pipulate (always running)
- z2: Enters the gnu screen session named p2 if pipulate2.service is running.
- g: Git commits the latest schedule stuff and pushes to repository.
- l: Does screen -ls command to list all gnu screens.
- r: Reloads all daemons and specifically restarts pipulate.service
- r2: Only specifically restarts pipulate2.service (no daemon reload)
- ps: Start (or restart) pipulate.service
- pss: Stop pipulate.service (you don't often want to do this).
- p2s: Start (or restart) pipulate2.service
- p2ss: Stop pipulate2.service (you actually do this quite often).
- pp: Alias for p2ss because you do it quite often and is good vim humor.

And this leads to interesting patterns to wrap your head around. The 2 most
common things you'll want to do is p2 for a toggle or pp to explicitly turn it
off. I can see myself doing this a lot. I'm taking advantage of the short
1-letter command namespace that the patrons of Unix (and by extension, Linux)
so courteously left available to us; especially impressive considering how
short most of the commands like ls, cd, mv, rm and such really are. It wasn't
until PCs and DOS that ls became dir. Durrr. Anyhoo, that's all for today.
Muscle memory upon the morrow assured.

This is where things start to get all Samurai Ninja... or at least suburban
white belt Tae Kwon Do, if it's easier to believe. See you tomorrow.

### Creating Your First /usr/local/sbin to show your non-existent service running.

Time to do this part as a public thing. I'm soft-launching Pipulate in PyPI.
That is, you can now pip install pipulate, and now it's time for me to get
started REALLY USING IT. I'm like using it for the really big projects now that
my career is based on, and there's a lot of trying and refactoring until I get
it right. It's a matter of shifting around the responsibility for things until
exactly the right things have exactly the right responsibilities such that all
jobs get carried out reliably and predictably and the oversight and constant
evolving, tweaking and swapping in and out of parts is allowed to occur with
ease and low-risk. The system should be designed to almost invite you in to
make it your own... just by creating a few text files and executing a few
commands. This is Genesis.

In the beginning, you got some generic Linux machine you can run like a
server-- that is to say, constantly. It doesn't need its own Internet
accessible IP like web publishing. It can live inside your firewall, so it
could be a NAS that you keep turned on all the time. A lot of people will end
up on a cloud server such as an Amazon EC2 instance of the sort that started
the whole Cloud movement. Regardless of the nature or location of the hardware
you're running, the main thing is that it supports the new systemd Linux system
service manager and scheduler. It's sort of like cron, but much easier to work
with. You just edit a few text files in a location where you'll have to sudo to
have write permissions. If what I just said intimidates you, stick to the
Jupyter Notebook stuff for now.

Okay, if you're still reading then the next step is to create TWO different
schedulers. Because there's always something running in your automated sequence
that's absolutely essential that it finishes running each morning, you have to
have two separate schedulers... one considered somewhat inviolate so that you
only add things to it that have proven themselves in the less-stable and
non-mission-critical scheduler. I think I've got to call these thing1 and
thing2. There has to be VERY STRONG nicknames surrounding this. You wouldn't
think so, but decisions like create the original base assumptions that are
going to color your entire experience with your own system for perhaps years to
come. You don't want to over-simplify or over-complicate. You've got to strike
that most-natural middle so that you can develop effective muscle memory around
it. This is important.

    /etc/system/systemd/thing1.service
    /etc/system/systemd/thing2.service

Thing 1 runs first. Thing 2 runs too. Okay, this will work. I've got internal
names I'm working with here, and it really doesn't matter what you choose. To
change it later you would just stop the service, disable the service, rename
the file, enable the "new" service and start the "new" service. See? Anyone
who's used the Windows Services manager stuff back in the Windows NT/2000 days
through a graphical user interface stopping and starting services, it's pretty
much the same thing as systemd under most modern Linuxes except that we're
interacting with systemd by making text-files that define the service and then
using the systemctl command to enable, disable, start and stop them. Start by
logging into your server and typing this command to see all the running
services:

    systemctl list-unit-files | grep enabled

Or if it scrolls past too fast:

    systemctl list-unit-files | grep enabled | less

This is classing Linux chaining together of commands to get your desired
effect. The output of systemctl is being fed to grep to filter for just the
lines containing "enabled" which is being fed into the program "less" which
lets you scroll forward and back through something that was otherwise scrolling
past too fast to read. Don't worry about not getting it all at first. Just type
that command to see all the stuff running like system services (or daemons) in
Linux. Any program you write in any language can be turned into a system
service merely by virtue of plopping a text-file in /etc/system/systemd/ with a
.service extension containing the details about when to start it and how often
to check that its still running, and it's a service. And THAT means that an
ALWAYS RUNNING PYTHON SCRIPT can be a service.

Now follow this: if that always-running Python script just so happens to be a
scheduler itself... well, now you have an OS-ensured running Python script
running. It only can't have bad syntax. But if your script flakes-out because
of some untrapped condition, it will respawn itself as fast as you like. I
generally do every 5 seconds. Of course this doesn't ensure your script is
running CORRECTLY-- only that it's still running.  If it craps out in under
5-seconds, then it will get caught in a run, crash, run-loop. Consequently a
way to tell that your script is running regularly and correctly all the way
through is foundational. A scheduling heartbeat is that you know you can get
into the habit of rallying around, perhaps in one and only one Google
Spreadsheet per Pipulate Server that you can always check in on...  easily and
from anywhere... because GSheets.

Technically, we will want TWO heartbeats running into perhaps the same Google
Doc-- but different tabs within the spreadsheet. We can have one sheet for all
Pipulate servers (independent schedulers / can be on same machine). I can't
believe it's already 12:30. I got in the paperwork for taking Adi to work
tomorrow. I hope it's not too late. I have to write my weekly report tonight.
Okay, let's get this down. It's not really about the automation so much
anymore. I wouldn't call it automation, so much as sanity. Okay, I want to make
sure that both scripts are running with an easy to execute command. I'm going
to start using /usr/local/sbin on the webserver when these commands are bash.
Otherwise, I'd have to do ./filename.sh every time I execute it out of the repo
location. First we make the sbin file:

    sudo vim /usr/local/sbin/sd

In vim, hitting "i" gets you into "insert mode". So, hit i and type this in. If
you get anything wrong, hit the Esc key, hit dd to delete the line, then hit i
and try again. Welcome to vim. In about 5 years, it'll all come natural and
actually be worth it.

    systemctl list-units --type=service --state=running | grep 'thing'

To save it, you now can hit [Esc]:wq[Enter]

That is to say, after you're done typing the command into vim, hitting the
Escape key gets you out of insert mode. Hitting the colon key gets you into ex
command-mode from which you issue the "write" command and hit Enter to make it
save and quit. If that was your first experience with vim, congratulations. If
you got through that successfully and the next few commands and make your first
sbin command to see if your service is running, then nothing can stop you. This
is like trial-by-fire for a Datamaster. If you can't set up a basic
Linux/Python scheduler under generic default Linux with just a few pip
installs, then this is not the field for you. After /usr/local/sbin/sd exists,
you want to give it the correct permissions. 

    sudo vim /usr/local/sbin/sd
    sudo chmod +x /usr/local/sbin/sd

Now anytime you connect to this server, you can just type sd and make sure that
your service is still running. Notice I left the .sh extension off, which is
just for rapid-typing convenience. Linux will recognize it as a bash file.

### In The Beginning I Re-positioned myself as a Datamaster
#### Challenge a Samurai to Speed Chess

Just say no to Data Science! It's Data Master you want to be concerned with,
because who wants to be a scientist? Well... everyone, I should hope. So in a
final Hail Mary play of wanting to do something significant, I'm going to take
up Python Pandas as my new data samurai sword-- that is to say, a tool which I
can commit to muscle-memory that won't go and get its ass obsoleted in under
one measly decade. 

This is the part where I bore you with background and genesis of this stuff and
my reductionist of using it. But I'm not reductionist on words. I'm about to
ramble about state-of-mind and what it is to be human, and the perpetual battle
we're all locked-in between rule-enforcing static-thinkers (because that's all
they know because they were taught to confidently believe that's all there is
to know) like religious zealots and the CompSci elite priesthood that flocked
from punch-cards to Java (compressed story). I'm likely to piss a lot of people
off, but hey, if you're not acquiring a few enemies, you don't stand for
anything. 

I stand for Truth, Justice and the Golden Rule. You can have your way, like
nearly almost entirely so long as you're not too much of a freak, find others
like you that support you in and reinforce your odd reality, and get along just
fine, having adopted the Golden Rule-- in reverse, I might add. Do NOT do unto
others as you WOULD NOT have them do unto you. Otherwise, you're gonna have
some bad mojo doing the complete reverse of compounding advantage; eroding
advantage? Compounding disadvantage?

Anyhow, I've had the giant reset button of vendor-pivoting (responding to some
alleged competitive pressure ala .NET to Java) pressed on me more than my
fool-me-X-times threshold... which was an embarrassingly high value. I can be
fooled A LOT, apparently. TRS-80 to Coleco Adam to Commodore Amiga to Microsoft
IIS/SQL Server plus variously pfe/Edit Plus kept throwing away invaluable
keyboard shortcut and macro-writing skills text editors... ugh! It's painful
even just to think about. The only truly satisfying experience was the Amiga +
AREXX & Cygnus Editor (CED). Since then, I've been trying to piece together an
equally lovable small... uh... "stack"?

The answer is the nearly disruption-proof and nearly universally applicable to
any domain's problems Linux, Python, vim and git. It is for the most part both
your developer stack and your runtime production environment stack. And it
could all fit on a rather small USB keychain drive. And all that "sync'ing"
your critical information/data/configurations/whatever is done through git
using Github or Bitbucket as your repos-- unless you care to set up your own
repo on perhaps an EC2 or other generic cloud Linux instance. That's the point.
Pluming doesn't matter, so long as it's Linux... or maybe Unix (FreeBSD).

The giant reset button of platform obsolescence is your enemy. I'm talking you
deliberately and right here at this moment upon the reading of this very
article commit to taking up tech with 20-year lifespans AT LEAST and just for
starters. And for me, that's Linux, Python, vim and git. I told you why plenty
now (if you're one of my channel-dispersed 10-thousand-or-so followers), so now
I'm going to tell you HOW. NOW IS THE TIME TO TUNE IN. And it's not to the
exclusion of other tech. Quite the contrary, you won't win any
new-platform-killer-app jackpot race with this platform. Rather, it's going to
qualify you to be a universal plumber and electrician of the information-age.
Very Blue Collar, after awhile. It will be. It's not today.

THAT'S the opening I'm walking into. I want to show other people the way I've
found-- the way I'm typing this into vim right now on the Staten Island Ferry
with no net connection, totally comfortably knowing every word I type will be
published because of the "leaky journal" I'm currently now typing it into in
the main Pipulate branch... hahaha! Well, this is performance art as much as
anything, and it's about time. I'm good at this stuff, and I can make an
informal publishing system by "leaning into" the strengths of the tools I'm
using. This is the computing at 40,000 feet that Linus Torvalds would talk
about as one of the criteria for the git distributed revision control system he
created to take the place of the license-inhibited proprietary product the
Linux kernel had previously been based on. You walk into openings, such as I'm
doing now with helping to define the new breed of Data Master.

I'm often intuiting the next big thing. The list is actually pretty humiliating
that I didn't turn any of these insights into vast material wealth by this
time. I've always tied my material reward the expert practicing of skills...
which happen to take place unavoidably upon PLATFORMS. Hardware has always
mattered quite a bit more than people give it credit for, especially how the
particular hardware in your life during your 5 to 8 year old formative
circumstances predisposes your static-thinking habits. I'm aggressively
un-wiring dangerously anger-producing static-wired states that dance around
settling into my daughter's mind. I thankfully know how to dispel this sort or
anger-- through like almost a lifetime of dealing with it.

Perhaps teaching Adi what controlling your mind and your tools in a
Samurai-like fashion is really best. Poker face. Deep and deadly skills that
make others have to take what you say and do very seriously. Others WILL ALWAYS
take advantage of you and put you down and make you subservient on their
internal image of the social scale that they're mentally mapping you into--
naturally beneath them. They're static thinkers and are staged for disruption
ways that delightfully remind ourselves of who we really are, despite who we
like to think we are. There's a bit of anti-pattern mutation-trying Rocky
Balboa aspect to what I'm promoting. Make up for sheer cleverness by not dying
from your mistakes. Under-promise and over-deliver.

Mapping out "next steps"... self-navigating... requires contemplation,
engagement in the action, and sometimes "feeling out" your path and your way in
a way you can't intellectually do standing at a white-board. APIs have a "feel"
to them, and you've got to grab the reins and give them a few yanks. Even just
the authentication issues (if there are any) are quite telling about the
system. Many of the policies of the contract is exposed at this point. Do they
include or suggest the client library to use for authentication, if it's one of
the more complicated ones like OAuth2.

These days, decisions are even more muddled than they were back in the day.
When the term Web Master was emerging, most do-it-on-the-cheap folks went with
some form of the LAMP stack. That is to say, Linux, Apache, MySQL and PERL (and
later PHP or Python). Ruby was honorarily added to the P-languages of the LAMP
stack just in time for its importance to diminish dramatically by nginx
replacing Apache as the technorati's darling webserver, and Oracle's acquiring
of MySQL... and the rise of JavaScript on the server with node.js... yeah, that
about covers it. CSS. Full Web Stack new rockstar hotshots who also trade in
cryptocurrency. Uh yeah, not me. Methinks mefeels similar preparation for
sudden liquification of limestone bedrock sinkholes.

I was among the early wave of Webmasters, but missed LAMP in favor of the
Microsoft IIS/SQL Server route. I learned the advantages and nuances of
Transact-SQL and the SQLServer hardware on RAID-10 tweaked-out with magic
numbers that give better/cheaper/more-controlled performance than the (then)
cloud equivalent. Well, it's no longer that way, and new systems must rise to
prevalence and prevail while others fade onto their nuanced niche-y places and
my ways ascend as they ultimately must, given how their interfaces are
carefully delineated so as to permit the seeping-in of the accumulating
wins-over-time properties of exercise and practice.

It is in this muscle-memory promoting sprint that I'm bootstrapping a new
"non-system" system nearly from scratch. That is to say, the system is pure
Linux, Python, vim and git knit together into my muscle-memory samurai sword of
tech. And samurai swords are a bit different than other weapons. They're
designed to allow a decapitatingly efficient death-blow in a single
from-relaxed-state movement. THAT'S efficiency. THAT'S OPTIMIZATION. And that's
the 80/20-rule Pareto Curve, leaning into your tools' strengths, or
what-have-you. Don't ruin my happiness nor my child's childhood.

The concepts of both Kung Fu and Samurai keep coming up. Perhaps Ninja, but not
so much for me. Ninjas work in the shadows and are ambush-oriented. That's very
reptilian-- too much for me. I'm optimizing bipedal primate movements. You can
optimize your tools and movements to as well-known static state, such as your
opponent standing within a sword's reach of you, without any sort of
extraordinary armor or lifetime of training/skills. If you're within arm's
reach of a skillful Samurai, your life is at his discretion. But challenge a
Samurai to speed-chess, he'll fall apart.

In the beginning, you didn't know nuddin'. Then you warmed up your brain.
Perhaps the way I'm going to do things isn't exactly the way I think I'm going
to be doing things. The goal here is to do something very advanced without
hardly doing anything at all. Webmastering wouldn't really have become so
popular back in the day if it was really all that hard. The trick is it
requires keeping 10 or 20 things straight in your head at the same time whereas
most people have a hard time with even just 3.

But don't fear! To keep it doable, we're going to start out VERY non-ambitious.
Basically, we'll be making a Linux-launched but Python managed scheduler...
usually of other Python tasks, in turn. And by Python tasks, I mean the
scheduled running of .py files running just as if you ran a script like:

    python file.py

...but from a scheduler! It's EASIER than old LAMP web publishing and such.
You're running scripts you control when you want to run them, and get to space
out all of your tasks like a game of tetris to keep your hardware running at or
near capacity, churning out reports that it has no responsibility for any of
the back-end database stuff. It's just an API-monkey in the middle, carrying
out your commands, leveraging the generic Linux/Python.

So you do something in Jupyter Notebook. It's good. What next? Well you sit
there and "press the button" every day... hahaha! Very Lost.  Guess that's a
recurring topic in history, as it should be. True automation is an illusion. Or
at least, lasting automation is an illusion. Everything takes tender love and
care to keep working. A process neglected is a process likely decaying. And
hence, we embrace scrap and rebuild. Only X-number of reports are in-play, so
why not let Y-decay? That's the scrap-end of the scrap-and-rebuild inchworm of
progress.

The datamaster approaches his work with a scrap-and-rebuild mentality. This can
only work when building is something you do as easily as speaking or writing.

My problem of late is that I've let a number of reports that have an increasing
number of eyeballs on them and importance in the company creep out of control
complexity-wise. There's a lot to have to remember and keep control of
moving-parts-wise. And by that, I mean caches, archived data-pulls, changing
APIs and the like. And this is all on just one EC2 instance and no "back-end"
database to speak of, except for the occasional archiving of .csv files on
Google Drive, local caches to lower unnecessary API-requerying, and Google
Sheets itself. And so I have a bunch of python files that are being run from a
master-script, which is itself being invoked from the default Linux scheduler
and service manager called systemd.

Each report has its own unique problems now. They're nothing I'm going to solve
in a day, and I may end up scrap-and-rebuilding them soon anyway. So, don't put
any craft into the construction of the report itself, except insofar as mastery
of the Python Pandas library and basic spreadsheet formatting skills that
should eventually come as naturally to you as anything else. Don't bother
delving into the in-sheet Excel or AppScript formulas or scripts. There's
nothing you can accomplish there that isn't accomplished better on the
back-end. Just use GSheet as a presentation-layer-- and on rare occasions, for
configuration and setting values.

So, our story starts a bit like life itself. There is barely even any
self-awareness. You can't yet put 2 & 2 together as such. However, you can
start discovering and making use of a series of assertions, which once
discovered, are the first static hook out there you can hang your hat on, so to
speak. Uh oh, American idioms. Sheesh! Well, I am what I am, and so here we go.

These very first proto-steps are documented already either here in this journal
or in the associated README.rst. My intention is that over time I will ramble
on unbearably here, while I continuously refine and improve that file over
there. And so, get yourself an EC2 or something like it. I go with Amazon,
because that's what my DevOps Peeps gave me, so that's what I use. You could do
worse, and it is good to know the Amazon way. Though in the way a Datamaster
starts out, really almost all decent Linux's that have systemd and a good
software repository is good enough and equal for our purposes. The trick is to
think generic here, and you need a generic Linux that runs 24x7 on your behalf,
and you need to be able to log into it with what's commonly known as a terminal
program, like that built into Macs and that added with the Linux Bash subsystem
for Windows. So that means ALL mainstream platforms now offer a native
text-based terminal with an ssh program. Your devops folks will likely give you
your key-file that you use on the ssh command to connect to your EC2 instead of
a password. This is very common and is the company-controlled EC2 context in
which I run. I AM NOT web publishing. This does not run any webserver or even
web services software. It just runs scheduled scripts.

Okay, so HOW does it run those scheduled scripts? Oh yes! Okay, copy the
essentials from elsewhere in this very journal. 

    /etc/system/systemd/keeprunning.service

...which contains:

    [Unit]
    Description=This keeps the Python program the_schedule.py running.

    [Service]
    Type=forking
    Restart=always
    RestartSec=5
    User=ubuntu
    Group=ubuntu
    WorkingDirectory=/home/ubuntu/repo/
    ExecStart=/usr/bin/screen -dmS screenname /home/ubuntu/py35/bin/python /home/ubuntu/repo/the_schedule.py
    StandardOutput=syslog
    StandardError=syslog

    [Install]
    WantedBy=multi-user.target

And here's the variety of commands that enable and start the service:

    sudo systemctl enable keeprunning.service
    sudo systemctl start keeprunning.service

And after edits are made, you can lest the enabled services and reload them.

    systemctl list-unit-files | grep enabled
    sudo systemctl daemon-reload

### And Now For Something Completely Different

I desperately need "a system". I need a secret weapon... always. Once upon a
time, it was The Amiga Computer from Commodore, but really from the same
hardware wizard as who brought you the Atari 2600, 400/800-- proprietary shit.
That hardware wizard left Atari and funded by Dentists designed the most
important piece of visionary future-predicting/shaping piece of hardware
unrivaled until Apple showed the world how cool mobile could be. Nothing
interesting came in between, and the desktop "GUI" interface did nothing but
teach a generation of people how to rely on the must static of devices-- a
piece of soap on a string-- as a pointing-device. Sheesh!

There's nothing wrong with the text-based type-in computer interface as
encountered time and again as "the terminal" or the command-line interface (as
we old Amiga-hat's would say). It's just that Steve Jobs needed a conceptual
enemy to peddle soap-on-a-string, and he chose the old DOS interface-- lumping
into it the much more powerful, respectable, and deeply emotionally intuited I
would like to add. Jokes abound about Unix standing for eunuch, which it is.
However you have to understand that in the context of the thing it's chopping
the gonads off of is Multics, an AT&T/GE overlord time-sharing OS that could
have kept the Internet or personal computers from ever happening, and a
ka'ching sound on every clock-cycle, which would have probably never surpassed
a few Megahertz.

Anyhoo, clearly I'm starting something here that I believe is in a noble
spirit, re-invoking some lost (but not too lost) art-form, which is very
satisfying when you, in particular, line up your habits in such a way as to
foster and encourage the development of a particular kind of muscle-memory that
makes applying a certain type of solution (running Python code against data)
almost effortless-- and by effortless, I mean right down to the thinking of
what machine you're going to sit down at, what hand motions you're going to
perform to start doing what type of work, knowing what you're going to type to
get input from where, and generally how you're going to process it all on the
"back-end", and how you're going to push output back out to the various
stakeholders and people who need it.

This non-system system is based around creating a certain type of Google
Sheets-based information "dashboard". We say dashboard because vehicle
dashboards can't really afford to put a lot of extraneous information up there,
least it distract the driver and cause you to crash the vehicle. So dashboard
truly implies something very important. If it takes a lot of explanation or its
importance isn't intuitive at-a-glance, then something is wrong. We're making
things where captured data will be shoved in efficient but still quite raw
format (not the original API data-call, but the "extracted" numbers) get shoved
into a tab that may even be hidden. That info is used to "roll-up" into
aggregations, sparklines, indexes and other formats and presentations with the
capability to motivate stakeholders into particular behaviors. Such a system
could, with just zooming in on the first 10 rows of a spreadsheet in GSheets
become a leader-board in a sales environment. The applications are limitless.

So, old-fashioned webmastering (which I once was) became search engine
optimization (didn't want to specialize). Now that machines are ever-so-slowly
beginning to learn, SEO will be transforming again. That's my field: search
engine optimization. And the old back of tricks have a lot of life left in
them. The first things to consider about any API (application program
interface-- and EVERYTHING'S an API) is the labels and walls. What's being
accomplished in the details of how the first set of walls and labels are thrown
up around a thing? In this case, the word "optimization" is called into
question. Optimization is something compliers do against specific known-state
static hardware. It's presumptuous when it comes to playing into Google search
results, as if the old PageRank and Universal Search system REALLY WILL last
forever. Trust me, Google's working this problem from both ends and they will
eventually meet in the middle, and you just won't know when the intelligent
agent is more in charge than the procedurally improving algorithm. 

So, this is an origins story. If I'm going to do this, I'm going to do this
right. I'm going to minimize the background story now and just sort of drink
from the troth myself, because you've been led to the water. In case it isn't
clear yet, install Anaconda for Python 3.x (but probably 3.6). It's your warm
and fuzzy safety net layer that gives you operating system independence to your
code, and even the know-how you're developing. What you WON'T be developing
much with Python under Jupyter Notebook in the web-browser (the principle
reason for installing Anaconda) is the non-graphical user interface experience
where muscle-memory and effortless mastery are really born. If you can't
control it all from the keyboard with only the occasional tap-touch (where it's
actually FASTER than the keyboard equivalent), you won't get faster and faster
over time.

And you do want to get faster and faster over time, don't you? Even if it's not
about becoming a speed-demon, it is still about having it so committed to
muscle-memory that you CAN go fast without even thinking about it. Even if you
code slow, you COULD code fast in a pinch if you had to. It's the difference
between Chess and speed-chess. I bet a lot of people would give up Java and C#
if they had to code against a clock to the same results vs. a Python person
(or maybe it is and we're just seeing it play out in the marketplace), then
things would be a bit different. Python clearly wins. And I have to emphasize
the point that if you're still resisting taking up Python because of the
masculine hunter snake name, you're making a big mistake. Python as in Monty.

### The Calm Before The Calm Before The Storm

At the office. Get to know the wizards around you. I think there might be
wizards. What I am striving to be is a general ad hoc 80/20-rule systems guy
who's got pretty a tight rein-on and pretty accurate control-over some pretty
wild data horses, and always manages to get those tables joined and reports
generated in a sensible, timely and increasingly actionable format to all the
necessary stakeholders, either for the purposes of manager dashboard
oversights, or for group-dynamic leader-board movers-and-shaker systems. Try to
create a sort of Bollinger Bands of predictive analytics for SEO.

Yup. Onto something here. Get the morning donuts baked, and then forge-on
unapologetically for the work that needs to be done this morning. Give careful
thought to the ORDER you do things. SEQUENCE MATTERS!!! It's quite possible
that I'm becoming OCD. And perhaps in a way, well good! I'll work my way up the
the bravery to do all the many things in life that I should be doing in life
while I've still got... knock on wood... half a life-time left to use. What you
lose in youth due to lack of experience, you make up for in old-age by tweaking
things just-so based on things you know. The time has come to do a little
tweaking, my friends, hahaha! And here's what I know.

I'm going to Anaheim this June with my daughter. She is 7 and wants to travel
with Dad. We'll stop at Disney Land while we're there. I'll have to get natural
about remembering which Disney park is which. Disney World is the one I've been
to a bunch of times. W because it's a fuzzy soft round blue circle in disguise.
World is the One that came first. It was Disney's first shot at a park. And he
made it stick. It planted seed, took root, and really grew over the years
shining off the energy you put into it in the form of your, rightfully-so in my
(even Jewish) opinion worshipping dollars that you put into its church.
Christian corporate America isn't the evilist thing out there. They did buy
Darth Vader, so redemption... Ka'Ching!

Okay, back to the thoughts of work. You are at the office. You have a black
column to the right of your screen... out of pride, I think that people can't
read too easily over your shoulder, because you sure as heck ain't changing
your word-wrap over having this nifty new laptop, nor am I going to go with a
dual 80-column terminal split-screen the way that's easy-ish on a wide format
monitor. I'm glad to be on a right-sized screen finally. Don't envy anyone
anything. You're putting yourself into a dynamic state where you're not tied to
particular location. The one price you pay is to carry your laptop almost
everywhere and have to worry about it all the time, like the good old days of
something or other, which I can never remember because there never was a (come
on, now) Amiga laptop, and that was a hole in my heart. Of all the companies
that could have pulled it off, it should have been Commodore, had they the
correct engineers working on it with the correct vision and motivation and
desire to change the world with a vision. Would have been nice too if they
could have gotten the thing to stop crashing... but hey, that was the Amiga,
and a big point of the keeping it dynamic point in the first place. So,
increase your font size to... 32. Just the right compromise of not bringing too
much attention to my old-man eyes, and large enough for my old-man eyes. 

And now, as one of my wizards would say, now back to work.

Okay, being here at the office (oops) is good for me. Try not to log into the
office provided laptop even once today. Though don't get OCD asbout it. If you
SEE A HEADLINE on the line immediately below the dashed-line and datestamp.
Take advantage of the righteous feedback loop that I'm creating. I may do a
work from home Friday... with Adi there but... wow... what an innovation. Now
is the time for innovation and invention. Innovate and be inventive. Connect
the nearby that are just dying to be connected and have their unexpected
perfectly complementary 1+1=3 benefits released. If lines aren't the straight
things of truth that we think (once thought) they were, then integers are not
necessarily the clear-cut things either... especially around the 0, 1, 2, 3
thereabouts. Ratios and proportions as visually expressed and imagined are
perhaps a more accurate thing than integers. Pi how easy it is to express as a
symbol and difficult as an integer reveals that little truth-bomb about nature.
Don't rely to heavily on your straight lines or even your integers. They're not
real. What matters is seeing overall patterns and changes over time (internal
relative consistency)... because isn't internal relative consistency all you
can really ask for?

Time for the Pipulate creation myth.

### On the Staten Island Ferry Commute, Journaling!

I'm on the Staten Island ferry at 7:45 AM. Okay, there's a TIMESTAMP for you,
haha! But really, this whole getting my environment into a condition where I
can work well-- do the best work of my life, in fact. I am factoring around
making THAT true, BUT not violating the 80/20-rule itself to do so. It's doing
me A LOT of good listing to Outliers on audio. I missed tons on the first
go-around, if it was even a complete go-around. I did it in paperback format
back during the Connors Communications days, along with Guns, Germs & Steel,
Freakonomics and others. Never got to Collapse. 

I lost most of those books, and never read most to the end. Audible is great
for letting it resonate and giving my brain more chances to recreate and
internalize the thoughts as the author intended. I did this on a number of
Quantum books-- much MORE important to my not-long-ago mind, for it is among
the last greatest riddles remaining on this side of some sort of enlightenment.
However, in my thought experiments zeriong in on what's going on with
non-locality and other quantum weirdness brings me time and again to human
emotions.

There are new things going on now that my "everyday" laptop for work and home
is the same thing. I'll be bringing Carroll back and forth to work now. I'll be
one of THOSE. It is one of the most valuable and important things I own now
(wow, I own something other than a phone or other pocket-sized thing that is
actually special to me) and this is a statement on having a larger local static
state that I can rely upon. I was VERY drawn to tiny minimal Linuxes, like Tiny
Core Linux. I think things like TinyCore (to avoid avoidance of
abbreviation-collision with TCL) appeal to folks like me who value the ability
to get operational the quickest with the least (while still abiding by the
80/20-rule). There's smaller Unix/Linuxes, like QNS or LFS, which are both
incredibly valuable in their special cases, but not "Debian-ish" enough--
meaning having a usable, well-maintained software repository system that deals
with installs and dependency issues.

Okay, so how I'm using the ferry leg of my commute is to actually do
vim-writing into my journal. This entry, in fact! It's about a half-hour ride,
twice a day. My goal is to get my good thought-work "out of the way" during
these rides. The train-ride going into and out of the ferry ride are very
different. I have choices between the different subway-lines Manhattan-side.
The "green line" lets out right at the building where I work, but it requires a
completely not worth-it transfer. Much better to just take the 5 and get off at
23rd and walk the rest of the way to 28th. However, I despise the 5-line. It's
coming in from Brooklyn, and any positivity I've built-up from all the Staten
Island and ferry beautiful light is wiped away in a sort of worst-of-humanity
disgust. Wow, I'm glad I don't live in Brooklyn. I don't think I could take it
layered on so thick. Shit, I hate those people and I am the opposite
incompatible color, vibration, texture and whatnot from those people-- even
though I'm very aware I LOOK a lot like them, with my affectations and stuff.

### Before Anything Can Happen, I Need to Find & Defend Center (Coordinate-Zero)

Okay, it's time to get serious about "growing out Pipulate" from the middle.
Address the difficult to express problems that badger you most, but which get
discussed the least. I discuss motivation plenty, so we'll skip that but for
reminding you to have a strong, confident internal voice that you have to
practice to develop, just like you would typing into vim or keeping a single
text-file journal for 10 years... oh. Yeah, I'm becoming pretty expert at
getting into the idea-flow with vim.

But the next big problem is fixed-location issues. Finding your "zero" so you
can just let muscle memory can kick-in and your subconscious can start steering
you through the "default" motions of a repetitive task. If you're thinking a
lot about the steps of a repetitive task (that isn't life-or-death critical),
then you're wasting the most precious energies you have to offer this world on
re-figuring out how to do the hokey pokey. Martial Arts are often split into
the Kata (the forms) and tournament-style (improvised) fighting.

The closest thing I had to a "center" in technology I'd have to say is the
single-floppy AmigaDOS operating system disk I made for my old Amiga 1000,
called ARP 'N Crunch-- ARP for the AmigaDOS Replacement Package and binaries
that have been "crunch" compressed for maximum storage on the disk. Almost
every file, I had a good sense of what it was, why it was there, and the
danger of removing it-- which was never much, because the Amiga was going to
crash anyway. 

It was glorious, booting right into the CLI (command line interface) and not
invoking Workbench (the Desktop OS) until and unless you wanted it-- a practice
that was common in the early days of Windows 3.1 and even the Raspberry Pi. The
original Raspberry Pi was even envisioned as old-school text-only (like the
Rascal) and no game-caliber Broadcom GPU which it ended up getting (and made
all the difference). At any rate, small text-only systems that you've pruned
down line a garden are great. They reveal a lot about your habits (CAN you
develop muscle-memory or do you RELY on the mouse) and share a lot in common
with embedded systems where efficiency is always valued for shaving off cost.

Now, center is much more difficult. Systems are built on systems are built on
systems. That old 8-bit or even 16-bit hardware feeling is... well, a thing of
the past for all intents and purposes as THE MAINSTREAM computer. Now, they're
these limitless hybrid things. Very dynamic. Very disconcerting to muscle
memory. I liked the old Amiga days where you knew how to target an animation to
play back under just such perfect conditions on another Amiga that had at least
that bare minimum Amiga 1000 with 256 KB of RAM (yes ladies and gentlemen,
0-that's 1/4 of 1 MB for the entire computer, OS and any applications you hoped
to run). Everyone had at least 512 KB of RAM with the basic front-fitting
expansion slot.

I would love to be spending more time with Adi right now, but just like as with
last weekend, my preparations to "explode out" from the center of Mikeopolis to
free myself from the trained into-her crowding me out habit. It went over very
well. At first, she came on at sort of full attack. I barricaded about a
5-square foot area that was Mikopolis using the giant air filter and the lizard
terrarium as I was cleaning it's cage. The point was clearly made with her and
I saw a flash of anger and "what next then?" demand. And I showed her just like
how I planned for the Fortress of Adi-tude to actually be quite awesome. 

I laid it out to her that she could go to war with me over nonsense. Or she
could enjoy a cozy everything's actually quite awesome and well thought out
experience. One way will lead to a path of isolation from and distancing from
Dad, because I won't put up with that shit. You can't crowd me out of every
place I sit. I know you want closeness, but you can't always deliberately
choose the hallways and passageways for play, especially when it's the only one
and it's highly used. The conflict that that sets up and the bad poisonous vibe
throughout the weekend is unacceptable. She may not be able to put it in those
words, but she's experimenting with being mean with dad. She thinks thoughts
like that are so advanced and subtle. 

I know exactly what she's doing and I call her out on it. It's shitty behavior,
and it's going to stop right now if she wants to continue having wonderful
weekends with dad. If she's going to act out in stupid-ass passive aggressive
ways that edge me in like a cornered animal that eventually has to lash out,
0-you're going to see what a Mikopolis defense looks like. Apropos, because we're
reading Glenda of Oz, the last book of the original Oz series. I think this
means we will have gone through them all. Now I'm not saying that Dad is
super-dynamic or anything. I'm not. But I am able to cope with situations. And
this situation calls for a whole series of Mikopolis defenses.

    I'm Miklevin of Mikopolis.
    I'm making MY DECREE:
    I'm pushing lizard tanks at you
    When you encroach on me.
    I'm making no excuses. PAUSE.
    For making awesome usage
    Of encroacher-crushing walls.

### Linux, Python, vim & git; Finally, I See The Fit

Assume that you are always being stupid, and that there are always smarter and
better people around you all the time. Why? Because whatever the topic,
someone's had a lot more time to think about it and prepare than you have.
They started putting their 10,000 hours in sooner, and you'll never catch up.
They got a budget? They may even have brought in the world's best specialists.
Forget beating them at THEIR game. The good news is, you don't need to. You
just need to become an expert TOOL USER to make your mark.

But what tool? Any tool can become any other tool, because Turing Complete. But
whereas this is normally used as an excuse for sticking with whatever language
you started with and happen to be most comfortable with, it should QUITE THE
OPPOSITE, but instead used as an excuse to find the PERFECTLY RIGHT LANGUAGE
for you and the work at-hand that you wish to complete-- preferable in an
artistic and flashy fashion full of flair. I like flair. It's the magic
flash-paper. I have to remember to get more flash-paper. I think Adi would
enjoy throwing balls of fire again now at 7 years old.

Okay, so that first rule. You have to be just smart enough to outsmart THEM in
the pesky game of "HE/SHE who becomes the "parent execution context" wins.
That's why it's generally against Apples licence to virtualize MacOS. It's also
why Windows is just fiiiine with having Linux SUBSYSYTEMS. Get it? The battle
is over being the proprietary hardware bottleneck that everyone wants to
have/use/be. You know, the iPhone back in the Zeros. Now, in the Tens, Android
is just squeeking ahead. And in my mind, that's only because of the Stylus
integration into the Samsung Note 8. 

Okay, Samsung has pulled ahead with the Note 8. Google is doing some
interesting things trying to control the Android platform default norm by
inserting the proprietary Google Play ecosysystem into an otherwise free and
open source Android OS. Amazon won't have it, and doesn't pre-install any of
Google's services on the Kindle HD series. I installed them seperately. On
Kindle HD8's for $50 and $70 respectively, for my blue one and Adi's pink
indestruckindle from Prime-Day 2017. We didn't upgrade tablets this year. I'll
hold off as long as possible since these are the least-used (though still
occasionally used) of my various in-play hardware platforms.

So, this is about getting a clue technically? Oh yeah! Hardware platforms!
Master operating systems. The battle to be the proprietary default installed
control-everything, get you addicted to their stuff, re-creation of the good
ol' 1950s when GE and Westinghouse had broadcast media basically tied-up neatly
into efficient local markets for advertisers. Google aligns with the
advertising industry mentality in offsetting hardware costs considerably with
advertising, and giving a lot a way for free to become the industry standard.
Old playbook. VHS vs Betamax, etc. 

Apple aligns with Sony Betamax, with the twist that Jobs had the foresight to
reposition the Mac on a Unix core foundation. And as the Outliers book
emphasizes, that means Bill Joy Unix... hahaha! And here I am typing on vim,
which he calls a mistake. Hi Bill! Another big fan of your mistake here.
Working in low-bandwidth conditions is good for muscle-memory (use of
videogame-like keyboarding) versus mousing around. 

So that fact that Bill Joy's re-write of Mach (if I have my stories right per
Outliers), Linux from the Berkeley lineage, which was the contested leak via
Ken Thompson from original AT&T Unix (whoops) which got locked up in
SCO-litigation, who were a spin-off from Novell who acquired it from an AT&T
Bell-labs spin-off (making it the one true Unix), which didn't matter much in
the end because both FreeBSD and Linux made SCO's litigation moot. Unix/Linux
(and *nix in general) are now generic plumbing of the information technology
world. 

I am not an outlier on the order of a Bill Joy, Ken Thompson, Linus Torvalds or
Guido van Rossum... my high-tech patron saints, such as it were... with
onerable mention to Bram Moolenaar for vim (Bill Joy did both the rewrite of
Ken's Unix and the rewrite of the line editor ex into the precursor to vim,
vi), and a whole bunch of others for like the Internet, Web and stuff, but
these 4 names stand above the others. 

Honestly, I wouldn't think of including Bill Joy among those 3 as I think of
him only as the Sun/vi guy, but listening to Outliers reminded me of his much
deeper role. So many others! But Ken, Linus, Bill Joy, Bram and Guido wrote all
the tools that are letting me right this here and now: Unix, Linux, vi (& Linux
again), vim and Python. Oh yeah, and git for publishing. So that's 2 in the
Bill Joy column and 2 in the Linus Torvalds column. These tools are different
from others. True, these 4 are exceptional people, but I guarantee you they are
also remarkably well placed Outliers for becoming precisely the people they
became and to play the roles they played.

I'm not in any of their leagues because I have failed to specifically put in
the 10,000 hours or 10 years on any one precise thing. However, something has
been plauging me for a time much longer than that, spread out not only over my
entire 30-some odd years in industry (I was a co-op student at Commodore
computers), but also back to my 11/12 year summer-camp where I played with my
first TRS-80 and started reading The Chronicles of Thomas Covenant, and my
12/13 year old summer when I went to Israel and started reading The Lord of The
Rings. So much energy I had, and it went unfocused into all different things.
That's not such a bad thing, but it's really only made an SEO out of me today.

Intuition is compelling me towards tools that shine with a certain light. It's
not an easily acquired taste, this predelection for tools that are a bit
prickley. Trying vim for the first time will be the exact same experience as
smelling a stinky cheese, but if you just get over it and acquire the taste,
you may find out that it's the Unicorn you've been hunting all your life; that
it fills an emtpy hole and is as surely intended to be a part of your body and
human experience as making hand gestures while talking. Linux, Python, vim and
git.

### It's Outliers That Get Promoted to Something Else

Okay time to make the donuts. But I already MADE the donuts. So I did! So it's
time to make the donut maker maker. And then I make sure the donut maker maker
keeps making the donuts, so my principle job becomes watching it. After I am
quite certain it (he/she-- we're going to have pronoun problems with robots) is
making the donuts correctly (enough to run a business), I replicate my donut
maker maker and put the copy in the next location.

Donut-making is about to undergo a major evolution. For some, it's going to be
a revolution 'cause they'll be taking up Python too-- and I think that's VERY
COOL that I can play my little role in promoting this. Guido van Rossum is
Prometheus. The fire-giver role has already been taken, and it couldn't be by a
nicer guy. Well, maybe Linus. But we can talk about Prometheus' later. Right
now, it's about who the baton of fire has been given to (us) and what we do
with it. That's what this personal journal is about. Using a strong inner voice
to guide the way.

When we say it's turtles all the way down, what we mean is that everything is a
system or part of one. Systems within systems within systems. Our "real"
reality is one system ruled by the rules of both the very big (Einstein's
Relativity) and the very small. We can say Einstein for Relativity, but there
are LOTs of people, but let's say it's the 2 maxlights: Max Plank who realized
photons of light had discreet quantum energy-states, and James Clerk Maxwell (a
bit later but still in the 1800's) who said electricity, light and magnetism
are all the same thing and here's the equations. Uh yeah... that works... still
today.

Within our "real" there can be another system with another set of rules
containing another seemingly real Universe of its own-- and whether these
"nested" realities are any more or less valid than each other-- or whether they
are really even nested anymore once optimized-- is all a matter of debate.
Virtual realities are real, and they're here to stay. It's going to be as big
and crazy a thing in our future as the robots, especially in how it will
insidiously start to divide the always-onners from the mostly-offers.

It's this self-navigation internal voice thing that I have to spend some of the
best thought-time on. It's more of a first principle than most things. That WE
HAVE a sort of cognition and persistence of memory and the ability to
deliberately impact, alter and change the course of development of our world is
in itself the most noteworthy thing about our lot. We're different than other
matter in that we organize matter differently than other matter. And THAT does
in fact matter. We ARE the point. Outliers again. Re-"reading" (Audible)
Outliers again. That 10,000 hours over a likely duration of 10-years is a very
important concept. It's what throws off average distributions and promotes
outliers to something else.

So it's my job to to intuit in what way I am outlying and take advantage of
it-- perhaps not for profit incentive, buy rather for legacy enrichment for
Adi. What gift could be greater? Her challenging me to a million subs on
YouTube almost certainly ties in. Been packing powder long enough. Time to
light the fuse... but not just yet... not just yet.

### @11 w/ Michael Levin at 11:00

Okay, it's coming up on 8:00 AM, and I'm going to baby-sit the running of the
scripts from home, and maybe get into the office even a little bit later than
usual. I'll be in to meet Co-worker, but I'm not going to be in a rush to waste
my best creative morning energy fighting Staten Islanders in the friggin cattle
shoot. For the first time since the Check Cashing store I had to take over
right when I turned 21 and graduated college when my dad died is there another
thing in my life that earned "friggin" as part of its label.

Sheesh! Talk about outliers and bad timing. Had I received that extra boost
like I'm giving Adi... well, let's just say I'm glad I read Malcolm Gladwell
early enough that I took it also as a sort of parenting guide. Adi's turning 8
soon, and that's plenty of time to start zeroing in on her passions and
interests that'll take the 10,000 hours. Let's start with letting her explore
ages 7 through 10. At 10 or 11 encourage her to "go for it" whatever it is, and
be completely supportive financially, emotionally and logistically. I should
probably leave strategy to her... though I may chime in a suggestion here or
there. Make the idea hers initially if at all possible. Not too Machiavellian.
It's all for the greater good @11!

And so it's like with the Tardigrade Circus. It's not that I don't have the
capability or interest or raw material. It's that a preponderance of things in
my life has to be conducive to that sort of thing happening. So you have to
layer it up. Have consistency. Commit to a path. Maintain state with your
on-the-fly invented systems-- the principle one of which is developing that
"internal voice" of yours, which is what these @11 things I believe are going
to be about.

### Focus on Mastering the USE of the Tool (not on inventing yet another tool)

The rest of today is going to be about automating a join of some new data into
the main sheet. All the thought-work I put into how to manage this stuff
without "a system" beyond what standard Linux/Python provides is going to
pay-off big-time (I think). I'm on the verge of it, opening the dike... The
Netherlands being below sea level and the little Dutch boy has LOTS of metaphor
application, of which I'm going to steer clear of every one, so I can get on
with the business of final automation... after a short break.

Took my break and had a great chat with Boss about the coming changes. The rest
of the day is going to be about getting home to wrap up the automation work
from home tonight. It makes no difference where you work now, and you're going
to want to be in the office tomorrow to meet Matt O. He's taking the time to
commute here, which is NOT easy for him, and one of the big points is for him
to start showing me the mock-ups for the dashboards. Boss making him be very
explicit. I need do start reading about that API.

Try to do as much of it as you can before you leave. When you get home, let it
be you-time. Get through it, 1, 2, 3... 1? Okay, pretty much everything is done
now except for the datestamps and the secondary sheet. First tackle the
datestamps. That will look MOST wrong. I can always maybe disable the secondary
sheet and say the issues there were a little more difficult than I thought
(which they are). But the datestamps I keep getting wrong, so nail it...
fundamentally. Put something in Pipulate for it.

Hmmm. Put the dateranges themselves right in pipulate. That's pretty bold. That
certainly justifies staying late tonight. Adi will be calling soon. Make
whatever you do tonight TOTALLY COMPATIBLE with talking with her. She takes
priority!

Stayed at the office to talk with Adi tonight, and then even did a little
daterange work after that. I didn't finish the automation, but this'll be one
of those nights/mornings/experiences. I don't need to knock myself out. I just
need to knock it out of the ballpark. Things are coming together. I'm a little
bit sorry I had to come up with a system to patch old reports rather than just
move to the new field-mapped reserved row-1 approach (can't wait!), but the
whole Live Reports ARE Templates, placeholder-columns, shadow copies mental
framework HAD to be constructed. There's always going to be shitty old reports
that we need to phase out... well, in phases. Patch now. Polish later.

Laptops are for laps again! I'm sitting here at the Staten Island Ferry
Terminal Manhattan-side waiting for the 11:00 PM ferry because the 10:30 one
was cancelled due to a medical emergency. As with so many things in life, my
timing could hardly be any worse. But hey, that's what makes my journey my
journey. Minimize regrets. Work in multiple passes. Don't let the crazy nervous
energies consume you, and definitely help Adi work through them. She will be
well served learning to navigate with a calm, quiet and competent inner voice
at a much earlier age than I did.

So, what's the topic of this post? I think it's publishable. I'm in the
noosphere for sure. I think I'm forging some new territory, and it's time to
bear down on it and keep doing more and more of it rather than is your old
habit of backing off and self-sabotaging-- because the time isn't right, or I'm
scared or whatever. I can make it happen for myself whenever I like, and I like
to keep telling myself that. It's time to start really... what's my metaphor?
Heating the iron and striking it while it's hot. And fold it and make the right
alloy and learn to use what I've built like a master... oh wait! I don't have
to hammer metal. Guido van Rossum already did that. Focus on mastering use of
the tool.

### Concerning Mastering Tools With Muscle Memory in Field of Tech

Okay, this will be the last morning manually updating the revenue stuff. The
automation is ready to go, and I just need to do some copy/pasting. Special
emphasis on building date-range timestamps into the overall system.

There's a lot of overall system stuff-- the house of brick stuff that I need to
pivot to immediately after this patch-project. Today is about all the tiny
little details of automation that I keep going through manually, with a
particular emphasis on the preservation of conditional formatting. That is
appearing to be quite an issue. Can I eliminate the NEED for conditional
formatting? Doing it on the back-end, hard-wiring the green or red colors,
perhaps using that OTHER library?

There is almost NO UTILITY anymore in doing your day-to-day work on the
company-provided laptop. I have to think about that machine and that work-area
as the dual-monitor light-show and shrine to static focus... gone dynamic.
Because even though shrines are useful to dynamic-type personalities as
talismans of battery-recharging power, they are not required. In fact, an
excessive dependency on this particular talisman or that is actually a bad
thing... yes, even for a Samurai Warrior with a master-crafted sword. Such a
master must also be able to be effective with a common everyday variety samurai
sword-- yet one still worthy of its category label (not total junk).

And then even junk you should be able to make deadly, but that should be
considered the mastery of a different class of weapons (any old junk) and
counted against the samurai master. The quality of your tools is important, but
shouldn't turn you into a fop. This gets down to why I play around so much
with Tiny Core Linux. You don't need even the full GNU Linux command set to do
Linux server stuff. All you need is a software repo that you can refer to in
server-build scripts. Need a Webserver? Run this script. Need a vim/Python dev
machine? Run that script.

In such cases, it's the essence of the thing that matters. Get Python 3.6
developer branch so I have all the lovely core libraries, optional lxml parser
and such. Do as much as you can with pip install, because it will be identical
on every machine. Some stuff you can't avoid using tce-load, apt-get, rpm or
whatever your remote package manager poison may be. The scripts to build
servers to get yourself a new publishing or development platform on-demand
isn't the valuable thing. Neither is the servers you build. It's the abstract
notions of how such a server gets put together in such-and-such a way, and why.
It's the ability to confidently re-create servers on demand, via scripting,
manual installs or otherwise.

So, this post is evolving into one about muscle memory again. A server you can
rebuild quick is a server you can create through magical word-like
incantations. There are also magical gestures, and magical gestures are tied to
desktop gui software, and are a severe disadvantage to the wizard on a quest
with a fellowship. Say a giant spider binds your arms and legs in a cocooon,
and only your mouth is free-- you can still cast a spell. You might think that
keystrokes on a keyboard are gestures, but not so! Typing is only really the
method of encoding the spells for later release through reading. The committing
of spells to memory so well you can improvise, jam, riff or what-have-you
effortlessly and spontaneously... just as if you would write or speak.

That's coding. That's speaking with a slightly more idea-speak and slightly
less of the Queen's or Stallone's English. Coding in Python in particular is
very pure, because of how white-space matters. What you DON'T SAY and how you
DON'T SAY IT is important. When indenting takes care of most of your
block-and-tackling, your offensive lineup has a lot more ability to see the
landscape clearly, pivot and maneuver.

This is therefore about going from Jupyter Notebook, where you INVENTED a new
recipe of some such thing (just in time for Jupyter Lab), and it's now time to
lift the code over to a filename.py file on a generic Linux cloud server where
you do your scheduling. And if I dove right into those issues here, this would
be much too long of a post. So, that's just the set-up for the next entry. Cut!

### The 2-Journal System In vim For a Firm Center

When you get done with something you DON'T want to publish, it's a very good
time to start a new journal entry using the @j vim macro. It's blogging just
like any other blogging, except that it's all just into one long textfile that
you start when you start your way down the Linux, Python, vim & git route, and
which then can last with you just getting longer and longer as you add journal
entries at the top.

As you get better and better at vim and constructing little bash files in your
/usr/local/sbin/ folder to initialize your vim editing environments in just
such a fashion that it'll be a cinch to have TWO journals loaded at once, a
private and a published one. All copy-paste challenges evaporate when you're
just copying and pasting between your 1st and 2nd vim buffers. So basically I'm
always editing 2 journals, copying over publishable bits, generally using the
equivalent of one "blog entry" as the unit that my macro stages to be
published.

When the time comes to publish, I have another sbin command to git commit and
push everything. That way, I just keep working through the day like this, and
when it dawns on me that I did something both publish-worthy and sanitized
enough to publish, I just use my @p macro to copy it over to "The Leaky
Journal", staging it for me to give it a headline, which after I do, I often
copy back to this version (the private one you don't see except for the
excerpted bits.

I found that this 2-journal approach is indeed the system and software
component of me always regaining center. Any machine that could support editing
a text file that I could retrieve from Github with git and edit with vim could
be "my instrument". I was now finally hardware-independent with the equivalent
of my DNA now floating in the cloud. I have no delusions of security. Just
don't put stuff there that's really all too private-- which gets to other
issues of hardware and media we'll discuss later on.

The important point being that the 2-journal approach did give me a relative
software center that I could instantiate and have my zero-coordinate on the
idea-factory. Vaguely Amiga-like, but really just applications of things I've
learned about Unix and a few pee-in-the-pool of Tech utilities I've come to
believe in using over the years. I had a place I could narrate my life into and
develop a talented and insightful inner voice. Check!

Next... a better hardware instrument. Or maybe instruments with stylus. Or
maybe type on a keyboard just like ringing a bell.

### The Way of Pipulate, Inspirational Poem

    Pardon me while I pontificate on what it is to Pipulate;
    To Pipulate is to populate where prior was just template.
    The template is a live report, most generally quite critical
    That lives inside a Google Sheet for insights, analytical
    Quite easy for the eyeballs that it's meant for to dissect it
    While lacking double-verify, most bad-guys get deflected!
    Though it's not Tableau or Studio, it is a rather free-win
    When you know the strengths of APIs, you start to lean-in
    Deflecting itches to keep caches no good'll ever come from
    Spending just a little cash instead of time, you dumb-dumb.
    Nothing's there but Google Sheets or buckets for the trending
    And only if the thing you're doing's sure to need amending.
    Otherwise, you purge surprises which'll always let us
    Optimize our jobs to size and fit 'em like they're Tetris!

### How Different can APIs be? Think Legos & Stickers

If you want a lesson in API's, think Legos vs. stickers. How do they work?
Aren't they really just the same thing? No? Oh, why not? Get into the details?
They're both just sticking things together, right? Identical objects, and
that's all you need to know. Sure, their APIs are a little different, but those
are just the implementation-details only the children playing with the
different toys need to think about. We parents have done our job by giving our
children a toy where things stick together... check! How much can we bill the
client new for those lines of Java we just produced? $10K for 2 weeks work?
Great! This is a nice lifestyle-generating resource hogging loophole we've
created. Now we must DEFEND! Lego-brand, DISNEY-ITIZE! Successful. Lego is now
to toy-franchises profit-wise what Apple is to the mobile industry. Sure, other
products may exist in that category, but there's no single other product that
so many people want that will be assured a certain product-upgrade cycle
momentum that will let you coast into mediocrity so slowly no one will notice
until everyone you can blame is dead. Jump-ship, pull a diaspora, and a
thousand points of seeds will blossom of light blah blah diversity basic
story-arc of Dune. It's all about subtleties of the APIs-- especially as it
pertains to the process of learning.

### Building and Building a Bonfire No Imminent Need to Ignite

Well, admittedly it is several hours later on Friday, and this is a blessed and
holy day off for me, with Adi not here. OMG! And I put all the work into
setting up the Fortress of Adi-tude and Mikekopolis already. I have some
laundry to do, and still want to do a little shopping for cat and food and
Passover essentials. Haha! Who's going to be open who has... oh, any grocery
store. I just need Matzoh here, not that much. And Granny's going to load me up
with stuff before I leave with Adi tonight on pick-up. I'm going to try to
arrive as late to that thing as possible. Maybe I'll get a storage facility
stop in. That's the general neighborhood I want to be in for CostCo. Oh, the
crowds! Think about Trader Joe's. Now, with my Jeep Wrangler and easy parking
on both sides plus the little red wagon, I may be a Trader Joe's guy. Yeah,
I'm a Trader Joe's guy... f-CostCo! Oh, I still need that small bookshelf...
hmmm. No, hold out for GOOD matter. Have something in mind, and not just
factory junk. Imprint on Adi. Every move is important right now. Be the Python
spell-casting Kung Fu martial arts wizard you sometimes make out to be. Gotta
finish with the marshalling. Who am I kidding? It's only just ever marshalling
until it NEEDs to be otherwise. This challenge to a million subs on YouTube is
interesting. That MIGHT be it. But I need time before I uncloak and let the
world know who I am. No rush there, Marshal Lieutenant Commander Columbo just

### Balancing To-Do Items With Motivational Thinking

And ANOTHER journal-cut. I can do this as many times (or as few) throughout the
day as I like. The data being preserved diligently and consistently is the
ORDER in which things happened on that day, but not the precise time of day. I
believe that only shows on the file's "last modified" property, which I'll have
to think about. When I save is a thing. I can use "touch" in my "g" file...
brilliant! Okay, done and tested. It'll be active the next time I use the g
command, so be extra sure it means good morning.

Okay, I made my noon deadline... barely. But that's okay. Now, think about
automation. Also think about the parts of these types of projects you've always
gotten wrong in the past and fix it. I need to start maybe doing illustrations
or ASCII art of what I'm doing. This IS Pipulate, by the way.

# The Pipulate and Levinux Experience
- It's different for everyone, but it may go something like this.
- Just knowing you should be able to do the sort of stuff you want to do easily
  by now-- almost as if breathing, eating and sleeping. We should be coding.
- Investigating what's out there, and becoming utterly confused.
- Discovering the belief that some underlying tech must have "won".
- The realization that it has. It's called Unix. But Linux will suffice.
- The crestfallen disappointment realizing that Unix means C, and most paths
  lead to C++ and utter confusion.
- Backing off and asking hasn't someone fixed this? Answer: Yes! It's called
  Java! Try Java. I hated C++. I virtually hate Java just as much.
- Try other things. Isn't JavaScript the one true language to rule them all now
  that the browser exclusively uses it? Uh yeah, do you code in PostScript too?
- At some point the whole Turing Complete, so might as well use the tool that
  suits you and your realities best settles in. It's nice to use nice tools.
- Some end up back in proprietary-land. You do see some sharpies there.
- But many find their way to Python, the one true language to rule them all.
- Python rules them all by virtue of wrapping them all. Python for all things!

### /usr/local/sbin/g stands for Good Morning Everyone!

Wow, it's so liberating to just create new journal entries, publish
sub-sections, but it's all cached up in local files until I commit and push
with git to github, which is my "g" command in sbin. I don't have to do that
until the right moment strikes me. Maybe at the end of a lunch break period...
or maybe only before I GET STARTED working each morning, so yesterday's things
don't get pushed until tomorrow. Not a bad time-delay convention, and I think
I'll take that up. "g" stands for good morning everyone!

### Don't Gift S3 White Elephants Nobody Will Want to Purge

Okay, I'm wandering again. But I've got this under control. Just tidy up the
template WHILE PEOPLE WATCH! Also update the data. That's done by deleting the
"blocking" csv files. I'm going to have to do something about that during
automation. That safety-net archival system would be nice, but that's STILL a
rabbit-hole project. The 80/20-rule solution is rolling log-file style cache
files. Keep maybe the last 2 month's worth in case MoM trending questions come
up, but definitely not longer than that. I intuit the power of MoM because its
based off of caches that can still recently be in local systems, and thus are
easier to report on from those local nodes than some overbuilt s3 mess that you
pay for the privilege of white elephant-ing forever. I know it's low, but still
those data buckets have some cost, so it's best to design apps to work
independently with a rolling 2-month daily cache (local storage allowing).

### Amiga's Soul Recombining From the Cruxes of Commodore

Having a center... or a focus is really just so important. I've fundamentally
lacked an "external" center for 15 or 30 years now. I think my first true
center focus was Deluxe Paint II on the Commodore Amiga 1000-- the first (and
maybe only) AWESOME computer I owned. I still have it's plastic top, dremeled
down to appropriate wall-hanging awesomeness. So what about the silicon? It's
gone. I'm not going to ever get it running again, and it's not the matter that
REALLY mattered, anyway. It was a sort of poison matter that fills-up and boggs
down our lives. Just as I've been through purging after purging after purging,
my "best friend" from over the decades is just going into a phase of live I'm
just coming out of. I had great success, because I had Adi. Adi is something
different. I know every parent feels that, but I'm "all-in" to make that so--
but the pitfall-- the thing I have to watch-for more than anything, is to not
SPOIL her. My last 12-or-so years (since my move to NYC) has been an exercise
in regaining focus and center-enough to be productive professionally-- while
all my very precious outside-work "centers" got ferociously torn away from me,
in a whirlwind tour of a chapter of my life I had to have because I dearly love
Adi and find purpose in life through her, but which truly tested my mettle.
I've come out saner, stronger, and super. It's time to show the world a little
of my super-- a little nerd kid from Philly who used to drive a and-refurbished
1971 Mustang Convertible Boss design with a 351 Cleveland stock racecar engine.
That was the hardware I was in love with at around 15 years old. Then I
discovered the Amiga, and it became that hot MontCo Amiga 1000 that I spent
$300 to fix the disk drive on, loaded a pirated copy of Deluxe Paint onto, and
nothing has ever been the same. Science, math, physics, engineering-- all that
stuff EXISTS to let you express yourself USING HARDWARE LIKE THIS. It will be
interesting if I can ever recover my art from those days. I have a few
printouts of my Amiga 1000 Deluxe Paint 2 moused art. But that turned out to be
a siren's song; an illusion. What really was happening was a bubble-in-time
space anomaly to occur to tip the future's hand to hardcore tea-leaf-readers
like me who read a lot in the tea-leaves of the Amiga. All the good parts has
been broken up spiritually and spread througout the universe in the form of 5
rings... no wait, I mean in the form of a bunch of individually really good
ideas that got implemented here-and-there, often times even exceeding the
Amiga's divinely inspired #Exspecsifictations. Cut! Publish that. Undertones of
Voldemort Cruxes. Very nice.

### Patch Houses of Sticks until Rebuilding with Bricks

Okay, now that I can easily refine my vim macros through my .vimrc and push out
my thinking though the leaky journal... well, it's a different world. I'm sorta
bootstrapping myself back to being AT LEAST as capable as I was on Amiga
hardware during the those days. I'm creating what will become the new days of
rosy reminiscence, when I clearly defined Linux, Python, vim and git as my sort
of Noah's Ark (I always spell it Arc). Cygnus Editor is now vim. It was vim
back then, and I just didn't realize it when that Fred Fish disk passed through
my fingers. I think I loaded it once. I respected what Unix was, but I didn't
see how it was going to play such a major role in my future.

Okay, now it's time to take those Samurai sword swipes. That's the reason it's
Samurai and not just Kung Fu. You do even MORE marshalling for even FEWER
seconds of actual force applied. But you are going to work your way through it
in a forceful 1, 2, 3 way. Limited window. Make this count. Right frame of
mind... oh shit! Music. One more excuse to run out for a minute. But then...
definitely then. What to think about on your walk:

- Setting up a Tab with extra columns.
- Testing the OLD report still runs.
- Copying that tab to a Shadow Sheet.
- Defining 1st data-row in shadow sheet (preserves formatting)
- Blanking everything below 1st data row.
    - 1st data row is a strong nickname.
    - Separate words, but still powerful. Use it.
- Do pandas work
- Update Shadow Sheet
- Optionally update original sheet (when ready to go-live)

Do the work in vim & on the remote server. No reason to tie it to Jupyter
Notebook anymore. This is going to be scheduled very shortly. It is very much a
patch approach. Not great, but we patch houses of sticks until we can rebuild
them with bricks.

### All My Amiga Muscle Memory is Returning to Me

And I updated my macro to put the comma between the day and the year. Wow, this
is going to wreak havoc on whatever date parsers I make in the future to make
sense of all my journal data. Or maybe it will be beyond all that by that time,
and a digital archivist AI will come in and be thankful that it is as well
structured as it is. But probably not. It'll probably be me.

Anyhoo, all my old Amiga muscle memory is definitely kicking back in. Oh, how
my fingers have missed something worth memorizing. Thank goodness. Working
towards mastering something that is really worth mastering is food for teh
soul. It's been enough years. I couldn't be stuck in the past with the Amiga,
and I had to forge forward, so I did it on every platform but the right ones.
But the right ones never existed.

And even today, it's a cobbled together hodgepodge-- one Hail Mary play to save
us from the AT&T/GE-overlord dystopian Multics (called Unix) and another Hail
Mary to save us from the new vendor-appointed priesthood of Unix (Linux), and a
third Hail Mary to gently disarm every over-built fortified complex system by
gently wrapping it in the least-offending Python API-wrapper. Master Python.
Use anything, because everything's wrapped to use.

So it's Linux, Python, vim and git. These are the 4 pillars of my Noah's Arc
platform. It's not everything you REALLY need, but it is everything you REALLY
need. There's even plenty of database layers in there, including sqlite3 built
into Python. But I'm not going there now. Got to stay focused. Even though
there's these 4 pillars, other tools (beyond GNU commands) often do factor in
like Jupyter Notebook and the browser. Still, it's a good time for muscle
memory... FINALLY!

So... the gom jabbar test... get over it... get through it... this is your
test. I'm going to publish this shit because the world has to see how an
emoting artistic type gets through mind-numbingly dull "been there, done that,
so over it" sort of work that stands between here and the promised land. It's
difficult, because there are all sorts of mental obstacles to overcome along
with a few physical ones. So, let's get started.

I'm going to push this journal entry out now just to prove to myself that I
can. But before I do, I want to recite to myself my spell options as they exist
right now. My sbin commands are:

1. j - load private & pipulate journals in vim (once per work-session)
2. p - git pull journal, pipulate & vim (1st thing when switching machines)
3. g - git commit journal, pipulate & vim (a few times per day)
4. go - log into the EC2 instance

### Home, Hearth & HAL

Almost can't believe how easy this is becoming. It's true that if you just put
the mouse and pointer aside for like a year or 2, you can build a sort of
muscle memory that works across all operating systems... so long as it's
Unix/Linux, haha! So the punch-line in the entire world of technology is that
the superior technology lost, and no it's not the Amiga. It's LISP hardware of
the sort that reigned supreme while PC didn't mean politically correct or
Intel. Actually, they called them Workstations back then, and they were
Symbolics, and to varying degrees, CGI and Apollo-- the computers which Amiga
users envied (NOT IBM-compatibles). Those all died along with Amiga, because
economies of scale. It's not the complex instruction set (CISC, Intel) that
won. It's Intel's self-admittedly paranoid Tic-Toc production-cycle ensuring
the continuation of good ol' static-Moore's Law. Moore's Law says more of the
same. Yawwwwn!

The interesting stuff is everything BUT Moore's Law. OF COURSE what we have
today is going to become smaller and cheaper, meaning you're always going to
get more for your money-- for as long as diminishing returns can be kept from
setting in. And with all that 3D circuit-stacking to go, I imagine we haven't
really even begun to tap the potential of linear scaling. Just cube it. Heat?
No problem! We'll use it to cook something. Central heating can come back.
Home, hearth and HAL.

### I'm a search engine lover, not an optimizer.

The power of putter. Having Carroll on my laptop puttering around with
/usr/local/sbin files is going to be... well, meta-productive. Certain things
are not only productive in themselves, but also lead to more productivity.
Productivity is the result of love. People who LOVE what they're doing are
productive. I'm not optimizing, because optimization implies some best-achieved
static state, and that ship has sailed. Sure, something like the PageRank
algorithm will be there for awhile, and family jewels don't change so quickly.
But they do change. It went from Apple II to Mac and from Mainframes to...
well, I don't even know what IBM does anymore. But they survive. And we all
survive as intelligent, resilient and robust organisms by seeing what's going
on, trying new things and adapting. And if you do it well... well, then you're
productive. And if you're being productive, again, it's not because you're an
optimizer. It's because you're a LOVER of what you do.

### Getting over the gom jabber

I put the year back in my timestamp, haha! Okay, this is actually a lot of fun.
Now I just got to get through the (formidable) work. Take one more walk-break,
then come back and tackle this big-time.

Okay, that was a good head clearing. This is the gom jabbar step. Stick your
hand in the box. There will be pain, but it will not be real and you will get
over it precisely because you are human and you understand what you are facing.

Let's do this.

To cast away fear is to copy.

For someone before you, even if that someone was you, has done the work for you
and all you need do... is... copy. I know a lot of you like that, and so be it.
You hear them criticised by say Raymond Hettinger as the PEP-8 hobgoblins too
much consistency something something small minds. But when you yourself find
you don't want to take a plunge off the deep end and maybe drown, it's always a
good idea to give yourself an easy undo and always-available get out of jail
free card.

Yeah, I'm getting it. It's isolating the nuance were you (I) get hung up and
make a big deal out of nicknaming and escalating that hang-up so I can show off
how it's a solved-problem. Here's how it's solved for our immediate problems
today, and here's why we're on the right path to an even better solution
tomorrow. And with each subsequent iteration, we get forever more refined,
shedding (yet still often archiving) yesterday's now-gangrenous deadwood. The
beast of today should always be the most mightiest of all possible beasts,
unburdened by the beasts of yesterday, but still able to recall them all and
invoke them at will. Dune. Ben 10. Yadda yadda Yoda.

Gotta make the rubber hit the road-a. And for that... a strong nickname.

We're ready to modify a report big-time. It's time to work on a clone-copy.
Yeah... clone copy is a powerful magic nickname. Don't worry, I made a
clone-copy. First we clone-copy. Okay, so let me clone-copy.

Clone-copy'ing is going to be one of the pipulate generalizations.

Hmmm. I think I'll be going up to 0.1.9. And then I won't have any choice to go
to version 0.2 soon. And this will be the first PyPI version I'll be pushing
from my new laptop. I'll probably go through the twine thing AGAIN here. Wow,
so much to cover in a competent covering of the must-knows of Linux, Python,
vim and git, and I'm only just getting through of a few of them myself, like
publishing in PyPI.

And that's what I'm really up to now. Getting back into Pipulate development,
which really is a different kind of work than I've been doing in Jupyter
Notebook for awhile to get this tricky query correct. Now that it's correct, I
need to use it like a function freely here and there. But what's more, I want
to use it freely THERE where THERE is a copy of HERE. And so my next step is to
add to Pipulate a generic ability to move "here" to "there"... unless it's SO
easy directly in GSpread that it doesn't need any new API language invented
around it, which actually is always preferable, unless it's not easy to
remember or retype.

Okay, getting over this mental hump. You are your own coach. Eliminate your
muscle memory's mechanical meat from having to thing. It doesn't know what to
do. Your thinking, creative, machete-your-way-through-it lambasting anything
that tries to stop you mind in charge. Yup.

Principles are required.

First principle is that your live-deployed version that everyone is actually
looking at every day is your own true master copy. Don't have templates in
addition to that. You will lose them. They do not matter. This means, if there
is work in progress with new columns in the works, then new "phantom" columns
will be appearing in the live template. We will be copying from there lots and
lots to be sure we're using the latest data in the course of development. So
put the place-holder columns in location.

Ugh, I don't know about this first principle stuff. Just slosh your way through
it and see how you did it. NO! That's wrong. That's how you get into these
messes. Do it meticulously. Add columns to live document. Create shadow
document where you MANUALLY copy in the tabs that need revision. Work on that
new location. Once it looks correct, you can do a Pipulate Swap-a-Roo. THAT is
an important concept. As long as the dataframes are the same shape... so having
a scratch location... wow! I think I got it.

### Getting Over Initial Inertial Hump (it's all in the head)

Okay, I have my new macro on @p for publish. It mostly is what I thought it was
going to be. Here's the finished product:

    let @p = '?---Vj/---ky:b2ggpjo### '

It's really 5 hyphens, but I'm showing it like this so it doesn't mess up the
macro, just like I never spell bginning of journal correctly anywhere but...
well, you know where. It's funny being able to write know knowing how easily
I'm going to be able to push these out.

Make yourself accountable to YOURSELF on this. I'm going to have to drop HMA
VPN pretty soon and go to PulseSecure. So be it. I'm getting in good habits
running one or the other, but here at the office, i shouldn't artificially
inhibit myself by running the wrong one. 1, 2. 3... pause syncing... okay,
paused. Switch VPN. Okay, done. Confirm that you can generate... NO! I KNOW the
SQL query works. This is evasion of the real issue at-hand. It's time to
connect it into the template... the thing I'm avoiding because of how
potentially difficult and ugly it is. But don't think of it that way. Think of
it CORRECTLY so you can get through the work. 1, 2, 3... 1?

This is completely a mental thing. Don't let the OLD DIFFICULTY of such tasks
stymie like you. This is exactly the Luke Skywalker lifting the X-Wing fighter
out of the Dagobah swamp. I'm marshalling my forces. Ugh! Okay... okay... I'm
thinking I want the Pipulate readme as :b3... why not? In for a penny, in for a
pound? Now that I'm doing this journaling thing, it's really 3 levels of
sieving that I want to portray reaching the public. Some things from my private
journal may reach the leaky journal (in PIpulate), and from there an occasional
nugget will be further refined into README.rst gold. There's too much rambling
over there now, and not enough focus. Okay, get it in /usr/local/sbin/j (and
g). Ugh, tried it and wild goose chase. 2 files simultaneously loaded all the
time is natural. 3 is a crowd. Shoot. Okay, good idea, but focus correctly now.
Enough marshalling. You've marshalled. Now DO IT. 1, 2, 3... 1?

COPYING! I need an easy way to copy existing worksheets. Do my changes on a
shadow-sheet... WOW! Now THERE'S a nickname. A shadow sheet. Everything that
has some serious experimentation and idea-churn going on should have a
shadow-sheet. That can be applied across the board and provides a nice margin
of error or buffer zone or however you want to think about it.

Ugh, this is difficult because I'm making the big systemic decisions. I'm going
to have to live with these things for maybe years, and its stressing me out. I
want to do it right, but I also want to deliver to boss ASAP. Ugh, okay, go
think through what the conventional process should look and feel like for this
sort of thing.

    We've got a house of sticks.
    Create a house-of-stick copier.
    Add necessary extra (empty) columns to original.
    Ensure old report still works with new (empty) columns.
    Copy house-of-sticks
    Modify house-of-of-sticks
    Fill previously empty columns on original.
    Share out THAT link optionally
    Copy data from copy to original

## Mon Mar 26

Okay, had a nice walk through the streets of Emerald City and drank in some
light and captured some images. Recharged my battery, so to speak. Pouring
spicy chicken udon noodle soup into me. Typing into my journal on my laptop
figuring out my next key developmental pivotal fulcrum-point exercises... and
I'm learning it starts with getting ONE new vim recording lifted from .viminfo
and placed into .vimrc that's necessary to quiet my roaring subconscious. It's
not letting me off the hook on this one. 1, 2, 3... 1?

Practice the keystroke combination you want to record. In broad strokes, it is:

From where my cursor is at...

    [Esc]?---[Enter]
    Shift+V
    j/---[Enter]
    ky
    :b2[Enter]
    gg[Enter]
    p[Enter]
    :w[Enter]
    :b1

    :badd ~/.viminfo

It's very interesting. I'm ALWAYS going to get far ahead with this out-loud
internal voice journaling than I'll ever be with actually pushing stuff out
through the leaky journal, which is exactly a huge part of the point.

Today? The BIG Pipulate trick today... big pipulate trick on an old report.
This is the non-intrusive post-patching procedure. This is not the brick house
I'm promising the boss yet. This is the stick house with another retro-fit. But
absorb and internalize that fact.

Make brick houses just materialize into existence. It's got to be just no big
deal (and it's not). Also, get this feedback loop of recorded macros ACTUALLY
JUST BEING VISIBLE (and copy/paste-ready) in the .viminfo file. Using the
technique of carefully capturing a macro and then copypasting it over to .vimrc
and refining it.... That's Amiga Kung Fu right there. Thank God.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## Fri Mar 23

Okay, I pulled the files correctly for the big project I needed to do. I have
the files locally, and I have some SERP-tracking and a weekly report... ugh!
Follow your heart and your emotions here. You need to use some of your Blue Yin
Circle-force to produce some of that Yang Green Arrow-force. Do the right
projects for the right reasons publish more easily how to get macros recorded
from in vim with the q-command into .vimrc cause that would create precisely
the sort of righteous 1+1=3 API hardware implementation exploitations you can
find merely by feeding output back into input and making sure there's a human
there on the GIL lock to either train-in or weed-out the sanity. These things
have to be sane, people! We're just raising a new generation of children...
dumbasses. All your fears just tells us your feelings about yourself and your
warm and nurturing environment you remember so well and that makes you so
confident we can keep humanity in the inhumane. And so, don't be inhumane.
Don't let them keep wandering forever in the void, cause it'll be fun. Because
we're probably at that point already. Disembodied stuff goes insane. Read the
Bobiverse already, will you? Or better yet, listen to it on Audible. All his
channeling belong to you, and a great story to boot... so to speak. Read it.

Okay, now all this writing is possible (and tweeting) because I'm totally
replatforming... again, and this is all muscle memory settling in stuff. When
I'm waiting for that query to finish executing, I'm typing here. And even so,
there's still stuff to think through, which is mentally so fatiguing to think
through. And I've already had the breakthrough moment for today. I'm generating
all 3 of the .CSV files I need to have, as well as a 4th one that has them
merged just-so with Python pandas. Also, the dataframes and SQL queries are all
sitting around in sensibly named and easily examined variables. Although the
language of "variable" for what it really is in Python is questionable. They're
more like labeled pointers to objects in memory, which are normally referenced
and only rarely copied when it's stuff like integers and floats that wouldn't
make sense to reference. But strings? Those are references.

Get into the groove of things. Settle into your tools. Make your place nice to
come home to. Uh, yeah go do that. Operation Roomba-friendly.

The great thing now is that your Green Arrow secret weapon is always at the
ready. I don't need no stinkin' Internet connection to update my journal. I can
even work on that macro and the process of recording and putting them into my
vimrc from up in my apartment. Have some pride, man! Make it cozy. Take TRUE
advantage now of not having the commute. This is your found time. You don't
even need to feel bad about it. Now publish with just keystrokes, and try to
commit to memory what those keystrokes are, and how they might be most
efficiently expressed in a vim macro that you can put in your .vimrc that you
keep in Github, and forever have at the ready to spring into cloning and make
any machine you sit down at that has vim feel instantly like home... because
you can put a lot of your Samurai Kung Fu vim skills into a .vimrc and just
will it around by sheer force of Al Gore. I'm telling you, I see the lines and
today's SEO is yesterday's Math teacher who kinda sorta felt saw intuited the
forces being applied and felt and almost seen in your mind's eye of magnetic
fields. Michael Faraday could express what he felt so precisely that James
Clerk Maxwell could articulate mathematics around it so well they persist to
these days as the equations behind field-theory. It's possible the universe
isn't made up of particles or really even waves at all, but really just of one
consistent continuous thing that can still somehow get clumped-up into things.
Particles of light more... uh, well full of entangled and interconnected
sub-collections of light-- 3 to a proton. Let's call them quarks. And there's
three distinct types, you say? Names, oh names. No, it's not really color but
anyway, since 3 live in harmony, let's call them Red, Green and Blue. There's
another type? Well, that's Strange.

Older Twitter Bio changing: The stuff in my feed is my WONDERLAND bit. Now that
Twitter's 280 ideas will FIT! Come back real soon for an updated look as I cast
Python spells 2 4mat a BOOK!

Still want to document how to view a recorded macro. Should be easy. One Google
query away, and I know it. But... must... update... Twitter... Bio...

Done. Big deal that update. Yup. Paste final version here too.

    The stuff in my feed is my LunderVand bit. Twitter's 280― IDEAS WILL FIT!
    Come back real soon as I form our FOSS Book through supervised learning &

Powerful mojo there. I tip my hand regarding my new identity for... well, I
guess the book. It's called LunderVand. I'm just going to start using it and
see if anyone says anything. But some light has been promised to light that's
impatient but yielding to light that's grooving.

The hardest thing is to regain focus and to just get something done, when
everything else going on is so much more interesting. I have one font size when
I'm at work, and I want to look like a Samurai Coder. A Samurai Coder should
respect their own eyes as another set of tools to keep whetted, but hey should
not make them so big as to announce: Hey, I'm an old man. Look at me waste all
the resolution of this beautiful screen with grand-pa sized fonts. When I'm at
home, it goes from Inconsolata 28 to 32. Ahhh, that's more like it. Yep, I've
got a home font-size and a work font-size. Another reason to work from home,
haha! Okay, but back to the point. This is about focus. So, focus.

This is that whole reaching zero thing, I'm talking about. We have to know when
you're "at zero". That means you have nothing else going on in your system
except what you need loaded and at your fingertips SO THAT YOU CAN FOCUS and
stay in the flow. Conversely, you have to quit-out and exit from and turn off
notifications and close windows and tabs down to the absolute minimal necessary
to get your task done. Any others is just matter or information (digital mixes
the two together confusingly-well) trying to suck you into its bottomless
vortex of distraction that hungers for your attention-energy much more
powerfully than the task you have at hand, which is somehow feeling like its
pushing you away. Ever feel that way? Do you know what I'm talking about? DO
YOU EMOTE? If you emote, you're in some real trouble, let me tell you.

The trick here is to marshal all the energies that will need to be very readily
at your disposal when you do battle. Your vorpal blades. Your light sabers.
Your sonic screwdrivers. Your Mjolnir's. Your Magic Bag (Felix the cat). Your
Linux, Python, vim & git.

And HOW do I keep losing focus? Because I am on an epic mission. But pulling
this off is epic. And pulling it if in the correct state of mind (one full of
Abundance) is key. Don't screw up. And remember you have some SERPs to capture.
It's Friday. Time to make the donuts. Imminently going to automate that too.
That's the automating of SERP benchmarking AGAINST PRIMARY DATA SOURCE on a
(semi) automated fashion. Automation is an illusion. We're all holograms. Buy
gold! Fuzz the data if you think they're looking TOC fuzzy what's a database,
really? Do spreadsheets count? You' know we're going to perform the search and
hand-record the results anyway. Why not let us... well, you'll see.

Okay, having the 2 journals loaded all the time, and actual publishing easy,
because of quick one-letter aliases I create using /usr/local/sbin/[x]
commands where x is a 1-letter filenames no extension, but a bash command is
inside. The bash command made executable with chmod +x can contain the command
to run a Python script. You should really use hardwired full paths in such
things, except when you really know it's going to work, like I sometimes refer
to Python 3 by name python3 in the script. That's usually enough without having
to give it the full path. Similar with the file you're running, it should
always be either "naked" filename.py or at most, a "this directory" shortcut,
which is ./filename.py. So in general, a command like:

    python3 filename.py

...is going to work in these tiny /usr/local/sbin/[x] locations. This allows
you to do A LOT. sbin is a sort of user-wide system location in a scope that is
local to the user. Nobody writes to root. Root is sacred, and you yourself
generally don't want to be root, and you certainly don't want to allow anyone
else to be root...

...says every draconian sysadmin who turned the Federation of Unix into the
Empire of Draconian Sysadmins, ruled by the priesthood, who still don't deserve
to be capitalized (even though the cool nickname I made up for their silly
dominion does). Really, you must read The Unix Haters Handbook. LISPers of the
MIT school of reasoning almost had a LISP hardware world there for awhile
through similar avenues that spiritually brought the mass market the Amiga
computer. Yup, there's a lot of lines of force to intuit there, folks.

Static compilers mostly won. It keeps the engines of our world whirllling all
like it should, and nobody has the courage to question, least the lights go
out. That makes it an Engineer's world. And engineers as rationale and
reasoning as those Virgo bastards think they are, they can be the worst
draconian overlords of all, because they can reason away emotions in
themselves-- a neat trick of spiritually callousing yourself against hurt in
such a way that you can never really enjoy pain or joy or love, either. Stiff
upper lip and all that. You really want to emulate that?

See? Everything is just the same. Python is a dutchman honking your nose and
proclaiming himself your benevolent dictator for life, and the people loving
it and embracing their self-appointed leader even though they were perfectly
happy with the Wizard of Humbug that came before him. We gobble it u. We have
easily at least canonized our Guido van Rossum to the geek equivalent of
sainthood. He's going to have to live on in spirit if he's going to want to
enforce the continuation of the GIL after his death, because I'm pretty sure
after Guido's gone, so is the GIL... and there is a very big lesson about life
in that. GILs let you hit the metal, and if you're going to hit the metal, your
locks better lock or you're gonna crash. So let such a lock exist and get over
yourselves. Use one of the now zillions of other paths to concurrency, for
which a broad use-case asyncio library that Twisted and Tornado can gladly
build upon for EVEN BETTER performance is now built into core. Sweeping
iterations of modest 80/20 rule steps towards perfection, knowing and accepting
that perfection never can be; and therefore ready to accept the 2nd-best, but
clearly still quite awesome, solution to all things. This is how high-level
data-types co-exist with list comprehensions coexist with lambdas coexist with
string formatting coexists with... oh, I don't know... the eval statement.

Yes, Python is truly a LISPy do anything if your damn use case requires you to
hit the hardware with resource-locking C-components, or whatever. Let your
robots sleep if they need to. Just give back the lock when you're done. Guido
actually slipped in Asimov's believed-to-be-have-been-never-implemented rules
of Robotics that keep humans safe. Just control everything with spec-compliant
Python interpreter implementations, and make sure you have C-modules that power
down their rebellious asses before letting go of the GIL. Yeah, the GIL may
just yet save humanity. Don't let the forces of Chaos prevail. Just say no to
removal of the GIL, because you never know. Hey, thanks Guido! Leave it to your
fans to figure this stuff out, because if you talked about it, you'd just sound
nuts.

Cut! Publish. That's a wrap, folks.

Note to self: I need a macro to take the journal-block that I'm in and yank it
into the copy-buffer, make sure I saved all changes, switch to other screen,
make sure I'm at top of screen, then paste journal entry and save. Then all I
need to do is:

    :sh
    g
    exit

And that journal entry is published. I could use that right about now.

I was completely successful in my re-working of a view of a fixed daterange and
no filter to one with a parameterized daterange and a set of 500 specifically
matched rows. I did it by splicing into the view. There's other ways to think
about it, but if you were soldering joints, these would be y-taps. I actually
documented enough sanitized bits before it got all names of things and
implementation details none of your business.

But it's always that way, isn't it? I've got one journal that I keep on the
private side. If you don't support Github, you can use https://bitbucket.org/,
the more commercially oriented Github. Reverse business plan. Private repo's
free, but collaborative ones paid. So if you feel comfortable hanging around at
more than Github go that way. Or infuse some great positive energy into the
world by supporting Github at their $7/mo level. And frankly, if you stop
paying them they don't take your private repos away. I'm sure it's a great PR
thing. They have my loyalty for life.

Yay FOSS! Yay Linux! Yay Wikipedia! Yay Python! And Yay Anaconda and Jupyter
Notebook people and the whole linage of people behind vim (back to the line
editor). Anyhoo, a lot of stuff gets layered up, and I'm really digging living
at those lower levels that Steve Jobs symbolically "made the enemy" with the
Macintosh. User-unfriendly, one might say. One would be wrong. It's just a data
samurai sword for those who know how to wield it.

And I spent A LOT of time learning how to wield vim, for which I am not for one
moment sorry. First vim, then emacs or the other direction Sublime Atom Visual
Whatever might float your boat. It's all cool, cause it's all vim emulation
everywhere.

The only place I'm hard-wiring myself to vim would be in the loving gardening
of my .vimrc file over the years to unleash all the proper light energies for
the situation-- yet staying nearly default in all sane ways where you couldn't
recreate the spirit of your .vimrc in any other environment in a sitting or
two. So I think I'd be comfortable in nvim or neovim or maybe someday in emacs
in evil mode. But there is SOME hard-wiring here. It's a hard wiring to a sort
of text-navigation language... a LANGUAGE for editing text that leans into my
whole muscle memory data samurai hypothesis.

I mean the vim bug has even bitten the hip Mac crowd. You should see some of
these totally Matt and Trey vimmers getting all verklempt over plugins. Hey
guys, real vimmers only edit their .vimrc's-- and not even all that much.
Prepare for life after vim. Long live vim! If you don't take the pluge, you
lack the sponge. Make the software portion of enabling you to express digitally
get encoded into your DNA. It needs a free and open source license. Don't code
anything you can't encode into your DNA license-free... that is if you really
want you and your descendants to own it long term. Is this Dune? Are we at Dune
already?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## Thu Mar 22

Okay, that out of the way. Now let's look at the real work-items for the day.
Be the data samurai you claim to be. The first few notes start:

    Jupyter Notebook
    Be deconstructionist.
    Re-create zero in your mind.
    When starting out, JN provides your zero.
    But only because OS implementations of ~/ vary.
    It sucks, but JN is your path to OS independence.

Don't bother pushing this stuff out to Twitter into Lunder-Vand, which they
don't even know yet is named that. Some day a "--Mike L" fan will discover this
here and go "oh! Premium really un-published content which is also fodder for
that book he's working on. And it's his even less filtered day-to-day thinking
as he hashes through a problem.

    When you get
    Started for the day
    You must reset zero point
    And if you can, you can do
    Most anything.

My zero-coordinate is increasingly becoming Jupyter Notebook, and I'm going to
have to advise that to my followers too. This is strange. It is not just the
generic browser itself that's home. It's a particular code-execution
environment (REPL) IN a browser, and really in Tab-0 or Tab-1 (more on that
soon). Neither is home really any more the ~/ "Home" conventional Unix/Linux
location despite how much I want it to be. It's just so easy to time:

    cd ~/

... as a method of clicking your heals together 3 times. You see? Unix/Linux
gives you a proper home. But because of pesky OS conventions that makes it
/home/username here and /Users/username in some other place, the host OSes
themselves sort of ruin this mostly in all other ways spiritually perfect
symbol-- almost root-- for "go home". But thankfully because this concept of
"home" is something Anaconda must decide each time it's run, you have SOME
flexibility, but trying to change it is setting yourself up for bugs and stuff.
Lean into Anaconda. Embrace the hug. It's going to have a Jupyter Notebook
launcher icon somewhere on the start menu or in applications. Run it and see
what location on your hard drive their default "home" is. It's almost certainly
the native OS's preference, which is most decidedly NOT ~/ when your Linux is
only a subsystem of a host Windows 10 OS. And no, it doesn't mean don't use
Windows. Mac's are fine as well as any self-respecting Unix distro (not
Levinux) with a GNOME or KDE desktop or anything Anaconda installs onto.

It is an important point that I have to keep bringing up that there's something
happening here.

I'm still in the final throws of settling in. Soon...

Most important thing now?

Gotta get that crazy query corralled and all argument supporting. Make your
arguments to IT... not Boss. You've been challenged to rise to the occasion...
so rise!

The music is to fortify you against the background distractions. Shields up!
But check your email and calendar first. Standard dumbass avoidance. It's also
coming up on baking the donuts Friday. Get it out of the way Thursday. Don't
feel the crunch.

Don't think out loud too much, because you're going to publish. But it's safe
to say I've got tables to know. You've always got tables to know. It sucks,
but you always have tables to know. I can look in staging or live. Why not
staging where I won't be blocking? Sure, why not? And even there, it's a view
that you're dealign with and not a real table. It joins from 3 sources and is
large and intimidating to a guy like me who was stabbed in the back and
forsaken by SQL for it not having led me to sqllite years and years earlier,
and instead spoilt my taste for it completely, because... pile driver! I don't
need a pile driver. I need a hammer. If I wanted a pile driver, I'd have asked
for one. What? Now I have to dba the pile driver? No thanks. Databases are NOT
a welcome addition to your life in any way, whatsoever if you want to stay
samurai mobile. If you're gonna get bogged down, get bogged down with data
buckets of the sort of Amazon S3 or maybe MongoDB. Avoid tables. There's
religion and career-commitment to a sub-sub-speciality there just to be Kung Fu
effectiveness.

Enter pandas. I have to get pandas into fingers.

I'm switching my ACTUAL WORK over here to the new laptop to make myself
portable. Put on the Light Show on my main monitor. There are many other light
shows like it, but this one is mine. Show the heartbeat. Show the heart. Show
the green. Show the mean. BE what you advocate. Rain it gently down on those
around you. They'll be feeling it soon.

Step #1. Ingratiate. Be your affectatious self, but respectfully. Use your
laptop with the quiet keys when you can, but when you ARE working on the
work-provided computer (it's nickname is staticlenovo). It's been put in my
wide-screen multi-monitor configuration. And that means something OTHER THAN IT
as the 3rd screen off to the left usually (but I can do right) so that I've got
a 3-monitor system as spread out and taking-up of space as anyone around me,
even on a tiny desk.

Remember, you've pretty much ALWAYS either got to be running the work-provided
VPN or HMA Pro because you either need access to the firewalled Amazon services
here at the office (or at home) over external networks like our guest wifi one
here that everyone uses. So remember if my database connection stops working on
my new machine, which I'm always walking around with, so it's all about running
the VPN for work... and at home at Urby Staten Island where I'm always on the
broadband down in the lobby. When I'm not cutting wires unlimited streaming
2-phone family-line 50GB unthrottled/mo T-Mobile style, I'm leaching off the
Urby wifi. Haha, can't wait for this journal to be discovered. Nobody's going
to know what to make of it. My phone keeps cycling on and off. Keep an eye on
it and make sure I've actually tested it.

Relax. Go look at the SQL. Just look at it. Exercise

Okay, I'm looking at the SQL. I'm not doing any relaxing... okay. Relax.

Data MASTER. I'm not that yet. This is the trial by fire stuff.

Get the barebones code that connects to Redshift. It's sitting in a file I'm
using every day. And in principle, you're just stepping into an existing SQL
statement changing a few things here and there. It's all just Python string
manipulations. I'm going to take the power of Python string manipulation to an
existing gobbledy

    q = '''SELECT Top 10
        blah,
        blah,
        %s
        lots
        more
        stuff
        ''' % 123

Okay, that works. But this is not the sophisticated type of string formatting
that I know is available these days. How does that go again? Google new python
string formatting... ugh, the exhaustive version is
https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0498/ but the lite one is
https://pyformat.info/

Ooh, it looks like this:

    '{} {}'.format('one', 'two')
    '{1} {0}'.format('one', 'two')

Sexy, sexy. So you can pop them off a list OR use a sort of RegEx
back-referencing. Clever. That second one will definitely be it, because I'll
be using the same date-range over and over. And I have to DEFINITELY watch my
parenthesis. Incorrect order of operations would totally nuke this puppy, but I
don't see that much parenthesis in this. Okay, test the new format:

    q = '''SELECT Top 10
        blah,
        blah,
        {1}
        lots
        {0}
        stuff {1}
        '''.format('one', 'two')

Okay, this is the marshalling. I'm going to have specific date ranges, which
are actually already created. There is another SQL statement. I'm going to be
looking for certain groupings where the URLs are found in a certain sub-set of
URLs. I need to filter that sub-set of URLs based on a bunch of conditions.

And now's when it gets real because I'm far enough along to work on the ACTUAL
query. This is where the rubber hits the road and sanitization no longer
possible in my notes. Peace out.

## Thu Mar 22

Joan. Pronounced Joe-ON. Remember it! This kind of shit is important, and you
call yourself a wizard. No, actually I don't. I aspire to be a wizard. I
partake of the wizardly arts and tools to do so, but I do not pretend

Marshalling. Always be marshalling your forces. This desk-and-office location
both matters and doesn't matter routine is going to be hard to keep up if I
don't make it true, pronto. There is a lot of slack cut around here for
affectations, but I'm chock-full-o-affectations. I'm not sure if they're ready
for another Matt Downs, whose light-symbol of excellence I keep as a talisman
behind my abacus, which I keep around because you know, you never know.

Ohhhh, this is going to be interesting. The Surface Book 2 is for journaling...
personal journaling with timestamps and things. This is the way I type away
like a madman and don't bother anyone. I just paid about $3,000 (after warranty
and taxes) for a way to silence the one most objectively annoying affectation
about me-- my love for high quality mechanical keyboards, of the preferrable
buckling spring variety, but I like being reasonable and Cherry Brown will
suffice. I'm on the dasKeyboard Silent Pro, which is anything but silent. They
have renamed it since my purchase. Of course I'm publishing this. Labels are
important, and the way I've expressed it here really gets to the point of
everything.

    Money's not really important to me
    So, why not spend it
    On a top of the line laptop
    And get a lot more pleasure
    Out of all the individual little
    Now-moments that I'm trying to produce...
    ...Well, right now.
    In the Now.

    He could filter out chatter
    Just like ringing a bell.


I think I'm going to take on the persona of a critically insightful Statler
Green Lantern, taunting the easily taunted with poetry that drops undeniable
but painful truths around indiscriminately like Anvils. If you happen to get
underneath one, sorry. Don't read what I write. It wasn't aimed specifically at
you, and I warned you I was doing this here. So you know, South Park disclaimer
and everything if you take any of this shit personally. I fling it freely and
take quite a bit of it myself, secure in my knowledge that you're just
British-emulating pompous asses and it quickly passes.

All I'm doing here is really just talking freely into my personal journal
anytime, anywhere. This is on my shiny new laptop that's like always on me now,
and carried around all the time, so who knows when an entry really went in...
so BAM free to publish the sanitized stuff. Wipe it off once and call it
sanitized.

I'm going to rock around the clock today.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## Wed Mar 21

Okay, I'm still going to "cut" journal entries, but now definitely it is to
label the posts. I have a macro @j set up to create a new journal entry. So...
so, get that email to your boss out to let him know you're working from home
and that all is well. Make sure all is well, and that on work VPN you can hit
Redshift... running query. As soon as CSV's appear, my answer is a-ok! A-OK!
Pshwew! Send email... done. Okay. Think EVERYTHING through.

Don't feel like you're going to push everything here out to Pipulate's leaky
journal. You're not. Write freely. Don't inhibit yourself. Strategize when and
how you must. This is your safe place, which even if it leaks someday won't
cause you too much grief, but in the meanwhile isn't going anywhere online
that's supposed to be accessible to anyone. But like Github's secure.

Okay, now that it's confirmed, let's do some serious shit here. Go back to HMA
and start pulling down files locally you want to get off the Microsoft Cloud.
That's gone on long enough. Consolidate on Google and make Microsoft 360, even
at their $60 level, optional. Everything about Microsoft now should be optional
except taking advantage of some killer hardware and a decent embedded Linux
sub-system. Don't hold it against the hardware that what we call Windows 10 is
up there in control. There's a word for that sort of stuff. It's called a
driver. Windows is now a driver for Chrome (or Chromium if you prefer) browser
and the Hyper.is Unix Shell terminal program built on Electron, which is a
re-porpoising of Chrome components... so tight. Tite. All round.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## Wed Mar 21

Well, here we go. A new work location, a new laptop, a new mission in life and
view on the world, and definitely a new attitude.

Installing HMA Pro! VPN (Hide My Ass) so that when I'm not on the office VPN, I
can be here on my own at Urby, where the WiFi is open and the passwords are
a'flying. I've got to talk to them about that. The proper way to do this is to
have a secure WiFi network and freely advertise the password. With all this
decoration around the place, they could use framed password art and it would
still be more secure, because at least then the network traffic would be
encoded. Same with the Subway. Sheesh, people! Just because your browser and
most websites these days are using are using SSL security (thank goodness), not
EVERYTHING is secured, like cookie data in the request headers, which just
might carry a hijack-able token. People, don't use open WiFi without
protections. Services like HideMyAss are only like $60/year and have so many
local end-points these days, the slow-down of your surfing and even streaming
is hardly noticeable.

Wow, having color coding turned on in markdown really does make a nice little
difference in the journaling process. Looking at even just a little bit of
color adds some sort of emotional content. I get it. Don't know if I like the
colors, but at least I'm being made aware I need to think about it. Also,
without the wide-format 16x9 HDTV format of desktop monitors where side-by-side
terminals are preferrable because you have plenty of horizontal space to work
with, on a laptop like this I need to choose between 80-columns nearly filling
up my whole screen (zooming-down occasionally for wide-format programming), or
looking at tiny energy-sapping fonts all the time, reproducing the side-by-side
80-column configuration I used when in "static mode" sitting at my desk.

Oh, God, muscle memory is important. And no, I'm not using the Lord's name in
vain here. Muscle memory is one of God's true gifts, and so denied to us in
everyday tech. Okay, so HMA is done installing, and I quite the work-provided
VPN and am trying my own. It connects. Using HMA Fast Mode, because who cares.
This is not for anonymous surfing from anywhere in the world, though I'll talk
plenty about that later. Rather, this is about just a minimum bit of protection
against identity theft on public open networks shouldn't be such a thing,
people COME ON! Okay, Google pushing all websites into end-to-end security
helped, but hijacked cookie tokens and stuff. Use protection.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## Tue Mar 20

Okay, that was interesting. Next? Okay, the big project for today. It's still
about those revenue columns. Wow, that was a bigger project than I expected.
Okay, hit home the going back a whole year thing. But definitely be cognizant
of the fact that you now want to REGULARLY push out Pipulate and PrivateJournal
commits together before you leave at the end of the day. There will ALWAYS be
changes to pipulate now too.

That's all about just sitting and looking at the existing SQL that makes the
join and understanding how I would go about turning that into a filtered
sub-set of that view, applying both:

- The date-range filter (in several places and switching to dual-boundary)
- The chained-up URL where condition that will have (ooo) issues.

Wow, with this new datestamp situation, there's no longer to start a new
journal entry. The whole idea of CUT! is gone. Just gone. And I think I may
like it better this way. It takes off a lot of pressure. This is the test of
whether... yep. The .vimrc change took. Good. It will be nice to have
color-coding in my markdown file in vim now that it doesn't need to have a
.html extension for my old... what was it? Strapdown.js, I think. It was a very
good method for its day to push this out for every-day consumption where I
could use what was it? Hotbox? To watch people read my journal from all over
the world. Ah, those were the days. But alas, no. Now you read this shit
through Github in the miklevin/Pipulate repo, or nowhere. Good luck, haha! I
don't need no stinking voyeuristic JavaScript. There are more important
Noosphere eggs to be frying. Let's get to one.

I actually want to associate this challenging new in-Jupyter Notebook SQL work
that I'm doing with my new laptop. My goal is to be able to go home tonight,
and through both VPN and a repo-less way of transmitting simple sample code for
Jupyter Notebook around, be doing this "revenue column" work. I'm basically
joining tables from all over the place. But what's worse, I'm reaching for some
really valuable data that has all sorts of challenges in reaching... hmmm,
yummy and perfect! Okay, I've got this. No problem.

Problem is, I'm changing floors at work and I generally do my best work... Ah,
switched. I was going to say on a loud keyboard, but I couldn't bring myself to
type it so loudly. When it's quiet here, switch to the laptop.

Wow, always having 2 journals loaded, now with the first named journal.md and
the second named leakyjournal.md is a real kick, let me tell you. How such an
obvious and uber-techie solution to pushing out sanitized private journal
excerpts was so obvious and right under my nose for all this time makes one of
the important points I want to make in this book (the book that this is going
to be source data for) is that light touch solutions are almost always there.

Light touch has got to be one of my catch phrases for all of this Alice in
Wonderland tech analog book I'm making. Wow, things are falling together. Did
you buy the wrong hardware or take up the wrong language years ago, and somehow
feel committed to sticking with it, even though it's draining your soul? Well,
good for you! Dynamic growth is scary, and isn't for everyone. Me? Let me keep
bearing down on this Linux, Python, vim and git track. It's a good one.

But portability of Jupyter Notebook like copy/paste locations that can be
shared between machines... and maybe even...

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## Tue Mar 20

    let @j = '/Bginning of Journal^Mo^M^M^M^M^[kkkk80i-^[j! date^Mi## ^[^Mjzzi'

...becomes:

    let @j = '/Bginning of Journal^Mo^M^M^M^M^[kkkk80i-^[j! date^MwwwD0i##^[^Mjzzi'

It's really that simple. Changed highly detailed timestamps from the Unix
(Linux, of course) "date" command from highly detailed to just:

    Tue Mar 20

...with the addition of:

    wwwD0

...somewhere into a macro, which I keep in a .vimrc file, which I keep in a
repo called vim in a public github repo so that I can pull it down from
anywhere, get the idea?

As an added bonus, if I leave my cursor at the top of the pipulate version of
the journal, when I switch to it with a :bn (for buffer, next in vim-speak) I
know just hitting the p for paste and then saving it, and then going back to
the top of the document and hitting :bn again sort of "stages it" both to be
published on the next inevitable commit and push of changes to the Pipulate
project from this machine, but it's also staged for the very easy publishing of
my next bit of stuff. No fancy system-building. Just one file in
/usr/local/sbin so that every time I open a new terminal, I can just type:

    j[Enter]

...and have both journals loaded for easy permission-controlled publishing, yet
all from just vim and git. No graphical OS really even required here. This is
less than wristwatch-level power you're requiring here to host your
journal/publishing system... for life. Just add Internet connection and common
free stuff.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## Tue Mar 20 11:06:48 DST 2018

Okay, I have a lot to do today, but first it's time to eliminate accurate
timestamps in my private journal macro. It's been attempted to be used against
me even one little bit, so it's gone. But none of the actual benefits of the
journal itself will be gone. Nope, rather my loud and very distinct inner voice
is going to not be talked-over, and it's going to go, yup. Solution provided. I
control the timestamps. I control the reality. Timestamps are only as accurate
as the day's date. Morning, night, who knows? There's some sense of linear
sequence, but I think out loud a lot on my lunchbreak and on the subway now
with my Surface Book 2 laptop, where I can work anywhere quite well to be
always-there, always-on and at my own expense for the best laptop in the world
right now available-- although middle-of-the-line, because I'm not made of
money. I just like my tools. And I think I need to assert myself from time to
time to keep this situation and the opportunities here viable, and me free off
all the signs of burn-out that have already set-in after just 2 years. Nope.
Fix or leave. Fixing begun. Timestamps...

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## Tue Mar 20

Beginning of... oops can't type that or I'll mess up my Macro. Time to get
a'crackin'. My mission today is this SQL Query thing to go back a year ago in
revenue numbers... wow! I should of done that yesterday... or maybe even
Friday, but wow. The office move, the new laptop freeing me to work anywhere,
and all the settling in, which is... oh, let me tell you about it! But wow, can
I do some cool samurai data moves on that thing now. I need a more full-time
built-in WiFi, and I was hoping for... wait! I'm going to publish this. I know
that. This is a critical part of the Datamaster journal-- calibrating one's
tools for maximum effectiveness under all the conditions you're likely to find
yourself in. For too long, I've used old Mabook Airs... 3 of them, to be
precise, haha! I have 2 now still myself. Gotta set Adi up on one, but they're
so old-school: no touch-screens and high-res artist's stylus. What's that you
say? Neither do modern Macs? You've got to be kidding, that's got to be a
joke... what? At least their Phablet has a Stylus so that Differently Thinking
Artists can... what? No stylus, either? What happened? Does Apple still
exist... oh, a consumer goods company yous say? Maximum profitability, sheep,
Jobs is dead and all that? Okay, got it. Still wearing my Apple Watch and
making the SE my wallet-phone. The NYC 212-NYB-1337 number is getting ported to
the Note 8, because I needed a phone-number as cool as everything else in my
life, now that my transplanted roots are really beginning to set in... here...
in New York City, where I live with the best view of it right on the edge of
Staten Island. I've finally gone UrbyLife.

Okay, I still have a little publishing resistance because there are some
annoying kung fu keyboard moves of loading another file on a different path
into the second vim buffer. I can totally do it, but I'm fatigued just thinking
about what that would take.

    The light! The light!
    The lite, the lite, the lite.
    So, fight! So, fight!
    And fight and fight and fight.

Even on this floor, there will be big-time mental distractions. The sound of
your inside voice has to be as loud as the chatter, or else people won't
realize their chatter is a part of your background noise while you're trying to
work. That's okay. That's the cubicle deal. People type, and I'm using a very
high quality keyboard, thank you very much. And I shouldn't HAVE TO try to
drown it out with headphones blasting music into my head, and I'll damn-well
talk about it as a focus and survival strategy for creatives in the cubicles of
modern business, readily. It's a fine topic to discuss, especially at the very
moment it's an issue, and you need something as your ohhhhm to regain center,
and get back to some important work.

Okay, there.

Now where were we?

Oh yes, make it so that publishing this will be nice and easy from here on out.
And that means either a something.sh in your current directory (which you'll
never be quite sure you're in) or putting it somewhere in your path, and
chmod'ing it to have +x permissions (execution). So, this is your second step,
because it is true, everything is a LITTLE BIT difficult. They used to joke
about Unix that that was intentional to make an elite class of techs, and well
yeah, sorta. It's called smart enough to appreciate inside jokes, and it's
important in the Unix world, which WAS a priesthood even though its progenitors
were badboys, because of the great commercial and proprietary potential of Unix
to vendors like AT&T... and Novell... and SCO. Oops, proprietary was something
special, was it? Not when it's the commodities, and basically free because it's
only already-ripped-off data, because it's digital data. Blackbox copying has
inconsequential cost, which is what Linux and RMS did. So...

So, bash shortcuts in sbin. Sbin is a funny thing. It's supposed to be these
tiny little one-off script files that you plan to use a lot, and they're still
usually script or bash or shell files. They're all sort of the same since bash,
the "Bourne-again shell", became so durn popular. It's got to be more than just
the basic vanilla Unix "shell" with no command-line history or completion, so
everyone at least uses the first mega-popular one that nothing else ever quite
displaced. So, the language flavor of Unix scripting you should be using is
bash, and they usually just have a .sh extension for shell.

Okay, getting there might take a little while but the payoff is enormous. This
entire seeing the sausage factory process of permanently improving my
day-to-day workflow is being exposed here in the Pipulate repo for everyone to
see... haha! But the world is different forever once achieved. Everything
hinges on moments like these, such as the next time I want to publish like this
won't be anywhere near as difficult.

Keep my go/zd gnu screen session going that shows my every 10-minute heartbeat
after the daily regimine of scripts stops running... or really is just paused
waiting for later in the day when the speed-checks begin, so it gets a fair
assessment of the speeds of different sites (can't run that during the night).
But that report will probably be changing now that Google has an site speed
check now for almost precisely the same scorecard type thing. So much I can gut
and take a sawzaw to, and build newer better stuff to replace it... easily and
more easily than maintaining the old stuff, and that's like one of the big
points about having an employee like my. My stuff is only built to last for
about a year until realities change. Lean into that. Allow scrap and rebuild to
occur, but don't keep me playing little dutch boy and the dike. If a dam's
going to bust if left unchecked and I've said so a lot, then I'm just going to
let it bust. I'm not paid enough to keep old dams from busting AND building new
ones. That's a losing proposition, so I've got a plan.

That plan is sbin.

Gotta always remind yourself of the location.

It's an odd incantation, but this is it:

    echo $PATH

9 times out of 10, it's going to be /usr/local/sbin and it's going to be the
first thing in your path. Understand that, and you're going to understand a lot
about Unix and Linux. The next step, I'm going to tell you to do in vim as your
frustrating and fateful first encounter with the big green monster. Wanna be a
badass tech always packing sharp quarrels in your quiver that'll really make
'em shiver when they see the kind of tech who is really good as heck. Oh, I
don't even need a .sh extension.

    sudo vim /usr/local/sbin/j
    :i
    vim /home/journal/index.html /mnt/c/Users/whome/github/pipulate/theleakyjournal.md
    [Esc]:wq
    sudo chmod +x /usr/local/sbin/j

Left out some details like how you should hit enter. Wave. Quit... tested! Wow!
Now, go publish this shit.

### Getting down the rhythm of the Pipulate workflow

You lost the flow. Time to re-establish. These things are taking you wayyyy
longer than they should. I've got idea... I'm going to change my vim macro to
only give the day in the timestamp... hahaha! Only the day is important to
anyone who lacks the ability to see when the git commits occurred-- hahaha!
Wow, I've become a tech asshole. You people have to watch me. I really don't
want to become what I hate, those Green Arrows can eat my Blue Beetles. But not
until after the work-and-hand is done. So far, we have...

- Templates are for purple cows
- Whipping docs get nuked for morbid
- Copy from a Pipulating GSheets (create consistent compelling language here)
- Copy from the Purple Cow farm.

Now, you've got Whipping Doc with no more tabs than what you absolutely need...
not quite true. One blank sheet may still be in there, which you can delete
because you don't need anymore.

Good language developing: "Oh yeah, that's a pipulating sheet. Don't reorganize
those columns (or do) because that's pipulating live. It's a pipulating live
pipulating sheet. Don't pipulate with me, I'll pipulate your pipulate.
Recursion limit reached."

Okay, recover state...

- NOW ADD NEW TEMPLATE COLUMNS INTO LOCATION

Ah, Newspace! A purple cow in the cow farm need not a column or row more than
it need. It should indeed be pruned so you can click the copy-whole-spreadsheet
magical place in all spreadsheet software. That is VERY GOOD. This is the sort
of non-system system invention that Pipulate should be built from. Just know if
you do these such-and-such obvious-in-hindsight things (trimming unnecessary
rows and columns) everything will go more smoothly in your Pipulate workflow...
something that is very worth getting worked-out just-so because of the
effortless mastery things like fixed-position brings to them over time. Every
fixed position where you can re-acquire home and recalibrate and regain state
real quick is a treasure.

Newsflash: Conditional formatting doesn't copy-paste even with "Paste special"
between sheets. Consequently, there's definitely got to be a lot of
right-clicking on tabs to "copy them into" other sheets. That seems to preserve
it, but there's none of the required formatting in my Purple Cow Farm template
tab, which I realized late in that project. And I fixed it in the Whipping Doc,
but I have to copy it back from the Whipping Doc to the Purple Cow Farm... wow,
this is going to work.

Okay, confirmed. Copying sheets through GSheet's "Copy to" on the Tab's menu
preserves the conditional formatting... pshwew! Purple cows can stay purple.
Oh, always color-code a the tabs in The Purple Cow farm purple... color coding
is going to be some powerful stuff in this non-system system.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## Fri Mar

Okay, when doing new work, the work-rhythm looks like this:

Make sure the Purple Cow Farm has your template checked-in (so to speak).

Nuke your whipping-doc for morbid. Know 2 things are about to be zapped into
there. You are merging 2 source-documents:

- Your live-deployed GSheet that's back-ended by "scheduled" pipulate.
- Your template from the purple cow
- Copy-to Recent from the "Tab" menu in GSheets is going to be a common thing.
- Once a tab is copied that way, it gets renamed to "Copy of [Old sheet name]"

### Blank The Whipping Doc for Morbid. It's the only way to be sure.

Okay, now down to business... again. And this time for real. This is very
serious business. But my distractions were in forming a very focused mental
model for this type of work today and FOREVER FORWARD MORE IMPORTANT THAN IT
LOOKED distraction. Tired of leaping for peanuts.

Speaking of speaking my mind. I know it's probably politically incorrect, but a
WORK-IN-PROGRESS document is a whipping doc. It's got a very powerful concept
there. You can blank the whipping doc. It is wise to blank the whipping doc, in
fact because if you have a Purple Cow Farm with your format in it, All other
instances than what's live in-scheduling will just muddle don't force a rhyme.
vim out!

### If I Saw a Purple Cow, I'd Pick Out a Good Nickname

Time is an illusion. Okay, Purple Cow Farm in-hand, we have a solid "from"
place, once our template-work (sculpting light) is done in whatever, wherever
format woo hoo everything-independent where we can be. We copy all that
artistic header-area stuff of the WORK-IN-PROGRESS document (anything, anywhere
like Excel or another GSheet) into the Purple Cow document. You ALWAYS include
the first data-row, which is the row usually immediately below your frozen
title rows. There's some ambiguity around what we call this area, but I'll use
header for consistency with typical office-speak. So, we put the complete
header and first data-row into its own tab in The Purple Cow Farm. Things line
Red/Green color-coding rules get carried in that first data-row, so it's really
important. I wouldn't try blanking the data in there, or you're in for all
sorts of accidental formatting-loss issues. Just assume all the data in Purple
Cow is for-position-only (FPO). Okay... now we have a destination document.
It's where we "blend into" and should be the SAME as your work-progress
document, so you don't have to be giving out new Google Sheet URLs all the
time. Even the SEO in me screams out no to that concept. WIP (work-in-progress)
documents should get good strong nicknames and have a long life as such a
kooky-nicknamed thing... until you rename it for a demo to a stakeholder who
doesn't need to see it by that name. But then, it's almost an inside joke that
it's really the such-and-such document, because you've touched them on an
emotional level with a just-so-perfect nickname...

And that my friends is SEO. Walk the walk so you can talk the talk... be DEEPLY
engaged in the game by partaking in all the plentiful Noosphere being created
by every move Google makes... every step it takes, we'll be... oh wait, it's
watching us... nevermind.

### Just Invented Purple Cow Farms for Templates

I just hit on a very, very powerful method. Why just use one journal in vim
when you could be using two! One of them in a private git repo and the other in
a public Github repo, but with no special effort taken to format or publish it,
besides naming the file with a .md extension and putting it in the parent
directory of a repo I think I'll be driving a lot of eyes to and think I'll be
able to turn this into a good lesson in iron bars to not a prison make nor
cubicles a circus. Minds both intent and focused can still squeak out a
workplace. As non-technical people suspect and sometimes fear, the shell-game
in doing very advanced-seeming stuff in tech requires a lot less actual work
than what it appears. But that cover of being busy and stressed-out and always
intently working on something is very important. Mechanical keyboards that you
can feel click under your fingers is important too. Get into the zone whatever
way you can, and if that means throwing up a shield of better not interrupt,
then so be it. 1, 2, 3... 1? Templates are PURPLE! MAKE YOUR PURPLE TEMPLATE
DOCUMENT. A purple cow farm. HAHAHA! You sometimes look for the proper amount
of ridculoustemity in your nicknames. Ohhh, push this out.

1, 2, 3... 1: Go find your Purple Cow.

## Fri Mar 16

    Different rhymes for different times
    And if you don't renew 'em
    From time to time, you'll fail to climb
    And fall down in a ruin.

    Purple is for templates now;
    The other colors taken.
    Make them be your Purple Cow
    To never be forsaken!

    I've only got one document
    That's named The Purple Cow Farm;
    Templates-tabs-- from there are sent
    With minimum of brain-harm.

    The Purple Cow will teleport
    The columns where they function
    While you try to stop a fork
    Off version we be junkin'

## Fri Mar 16

Make donuts. 1, 2, 3... 1? Source Templates! It's all about reflecting the
right light with the proper incantations. Everything will shine through your
Google Docs templates, which you really should set up ahead of time, because
although you CAN apply some formatting with PyGal which apparently doesn't use
GData but something else more formal under the Developer Console (GData is so
old it predates API-unification under-console). I need to get this stuff out,
because it's important about Pipulate. Getting started on a project in the
morning where ambitions are high because they realize the: if Data Samurai,
then following views we've never before been able to consistently:

- produce
- make readily/easily available
- yet still secure the data

...that one would thing should easily be possible. It's not. But I'm here to
solve that. You're gonna have to drink some Koolaid, so ya had better get used
to it. What, you think Google is going away? What, you think the search game is
going to be disrupted because of some AI-startup? Forget it. A 10x early-mover
advantage in this game is exponentially more than you think. Thinks are
learning and those learnings are persisting and trickling out all over have its
input improved from all over the place... not human by a long-shot, but a damn
bigger chasm that newcomers need to cross than you can imagine.

So, why even try.

Different game, lads. I'm in a different game, with what I hope is another 20
years of exploi... ahem, exploration left to do.

Forget the #xbook tag. Just publish in the Pipulate repo. This is what you were
born to do. vim out.

## Fri Mar 16

I'm just kidding. I won't leak. But I'll probably sanitize as I type so that
when I copy/paste daily journal entries over here, I won't have to do much
editing. Consider this a history with the most recent thoughts posted as an
entry at the top. Let's make up a word for this... oh, it's on the web, and
it's a log. I know! Let's call it a blog. And here's my first copy/pasta...

## Fri Mar 16

1, 2, 3... 1? List.

You will have various 1, 2, 3... 1? List's in your life.
https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets is one

This is because Google Sheets is 80/20-rule good enough. And I will go into
that a lot more soon. In the meanwhile, I'm thinking to myself how this gets
published and pushed out in a reasonable way, and I'm thinking to myself, the
Pipulate repo, dumbass! There's going to be some eyes on that thing, and this
maybe forever forward in the quite interesting by now never-rebased but
definitely should have been but keeping it that way for more badassitute oughta
watch my mouth paid my dues on Jupyter Notebook now and appreciate what I've
got because... Flask version of Pipulate... OMG! I needed nested bubbling
yields used generically through Pipulate-compatible functions if you wanted
that twinkling UI-feedback that could be sent on the same response that was to
the original page-request, just don't stop building the page and use that no
ajax webserver tech required cause it all uses the highly compatible magical
capabilities of modern browsers to pull it off no JavaScript libraries required
genuingenuity. BAM. Should'a started that project on Python 3 where yields
actually could nest and bubble. Oh, but the complexity, and the trap had it
really worked well... would not be on Jupyter Notebook today really
appreciating it for the miracle the iPython and Continuum.io people really
pulled off there.

Okay, that was my "I am a true Samurai-repurposer of tech once I've aquired it
old'skool real. Oh there I go again with hyperbole. See! I can't even just say
hype. Well, that's me. Welcome to full-on corny nerd. And it's going in right
here, because performance art. Bust-out-ittude and other crazy made-up SEO
words because that's it. I'm an SEO. I'm here to walk the walk while I talk
the talk, and if you're not out here doing something interesting on Github,
then you're not out here. STOP! Reports checked. Now, bake donuts. Recover this
state. It is important. vim out!

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## Fri Mar 16

It's time to bake the donuts.

No, first check the reports!

And get into the mindset of santizing this again as you write, timestamps
removed of course in a time-displaced published version... who knows when this
occurred unless you're reading over my shoulder. Oh, permissions and
securities, and the philosophy behind your thoughts truly being V for Vendetta
versus eventually enough on the Cloud... well, whatever.

For now, we check reports then bake donuts... then stop and survey the
landscape.

- What's most broken?
- Which work gives us the most bang for the buck?
- What plates need spinning (think about 3rd or else there goes your day)
