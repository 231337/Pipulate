# WARNING: These instructions apply to Debian-style Linuxes, like Ubuntu.
# You may have to update the /var/pipulate/ path to reflect your repository
# location. This file is what makes Pipulate "auto-start" like Apache.
# It will only work properly when Flask is NOT run in debug mode, because debug
# mode produces 2 instances of python. I left the commented-out line under the
# "stop" case to make it work in debug mode, but it will conflict with running
# the Pipulate Scheduler on the same server if you chose to go that route.
# Because Pipulate has such verbose console output, I recommend ensuring the
# app.run line in pipulate.py appears like this:

#  app.run(host='0.0.0.0', port=8888, debug=False)

# This is the startstop daemon script that goes in /etc/init.d/ by executing
# this command with the pipulate repsitory as your current directory:

# cp systuff/daemons/webpipulate /etc/init.d/webpipulate

# Once it's in location, you have to make the dameon activate on startup by
# executing this command one time on the server:

# update-rc.d webpipulate enable

# In additon to Pipulate web server automatically starting on server reboots,
# You will now be able to stop or start the Ppulate web server with:

# /etc/init.d/webpipulate start
# /etc/init.d/webpipulate stop
